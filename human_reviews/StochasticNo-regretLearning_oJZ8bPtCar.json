      "1. It was not clear to me what are the guarantees for the expected regret of the sum of all players and what is the statement for the pseudo-regret of the sum of all players. Can you please clarify",
      "2. Obtaining convergence to a weak CCE via a pseudo-regret has been typically described in the literature? Is there any novelty in this point? I assume no, the ingenuity starts with the variance reduction methods, correct?",
      "3. The authors proposed LVE instead of classical IWE with exploration term. Can the authors explain the details of their estimator. It would help if they provide some extended answer. how they derive this estimator. Is it something standard in the literature?",
      "4. There is another point which was not clear, the regret statements are correct if all the players employ the same algorithm? Do we have the adversarial 1/\\sqrt{T} case, if one of the players plays adversarially/stochastically?"

But nowhere, is the actual \u03c3^ik used and all the proofs mainly require the gradient, which is the term on the right hand side. I think it might be better to say that we compute the gradient of h, than the actual estimate \u03c3^ik."
