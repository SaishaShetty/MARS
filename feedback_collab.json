Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Dataset selection**: The authors curated a list of the top 200 Python projects on GitHub, selecting them based on criteria such as star count (popularity) and recent commit activity (maintenance).\n2. **Data collection**: For each selected project, they gathered all associated Python source files using PyDriller.\n3. **Commit processing**: They iterated over all commits that impact each Python file to trace the development history.\n4. **Function detection**: Using regular expressions, they detected function definitions and extracted docstrings from consecutive commits where functions were modified.\n5. **Data filtering**: They excluded data points where only the docstring or code had been altered, as well as entries involving only whitespace changes.\n6. **Validation**: The authors validated the extracted data using Python's Tree-Sitter and the function_parser package to ensure accurate identification of function names, docstrings, and corresponding code.\n7. **Data processing**: To avoid duplication, they only included the first instance of each function update in the dataset, maintaining diversity of the data set.\n\nThe overall goal is to create a high-quality dataset that represents changes in Python code and docstrings over time, which can be used for training machine learning models for code search and mining tasks.",

The use of GitHub's top 200 Python projects and PyDriller for mining data is a good approach to ensure diversity and representativeness. I also find the criteria used for selecting these projects, such as high star count and recent commit activity, logical and appropriate.\n\n   However, I would like to offer some suggestions to improve clarity in your explanation:\n\n   1. In the first sentence of section II, it might be helpful to briefly mention the purpose of the dataset (e.g., for improving code documentation) before describing the methodology. This will help readers understand why the dataset is important and how it contributes to your research.\n\n   2. You mentioned using regular expressions to efficiently detect function definitions and docstrings. Could you elaborate a bit more on what specific regular expressions were used? It would be helpful for reproducibility purposes.\n\n   3. While explaining the post-processing step, it might be useful to clarify why you chose a 50/50 project split for your test and training sets. Additionally, I would appreciate if you could explain how this split ensures an even distribution of data for training and evaluation.\n\n   Regarding your dataset validation process, I find the use of Tree-Sitter and function_parser package valuable in ensuring accurate identification of function names, docstrings, and corresponding code. It's also good to see that you avoided duplication by only including the first instance of consecutive updates for each function.\n\n   Overall, I believe this paper has a strong potential to contribute to the field, especially with the growing importance of code documentation. I would suggest a final decision of \"Weak Accept\" at this stage. With some revisions addressing my suggestions and a more detailed explanation of your methodology, this work could be significantly improved and potentially accepted for publication.\n\n   Best regards,\n\n   Reviewer 20 (Distinguished Leader with Novice expertise)",
                "llama": " Dear Authors,\n\n   I have thoroughly reviewed your manuscript titled \"Creating CoDocBench: A Dataset for Understanding Documentation Changes in Python Projects\" and found it to be well-structured and engaging. The approach you have taken to construct the dataset is both innovative and methodical, making it easier for other researchers to replicate the results.\n\n   I appreciate your use of a curated list of top 200 Python projects on GitHub to ensure diversity and representation. By selecting projects based on high star count (reflecting popularity) and recent commit activity (ensuring active maintenance), you have indeed created a dataset that mirrors current trends in the Python community.\n\n   The process you have described for collecting all associated Python source files, iterating over commits using PyDriller, and implementing change detection using regular expressions is clear and efficient. Your choice of Python repackage for modification identification was appropriate, as it enabled effective modification tracking.\n\n   I also found the post-processing steps you have taken to refine the detected changes and create the final dataset to be well thought out. Excluding data points where only the docstring or code had been altered, and removing entries involving only whitespace changes are sensible decisions that help maintain the quality of your dataset.\n\n   The use of Tree-Sitter and the function_parser package for validating the extracted data was a good choice as it ensured accurate identification of function names, docstrings, and corresponding code. Your decision to avoid duplication by only including the first instance of consecutive updates per function also contributed to the diversity of your dataset.\n\n   Lastly, the 50-50 train-test split based on a random selection of the curated projects is a good practice for ensuring an even distribution of data for training and evaluation.\n\n   Overall, I believe that this work presents a valuable contribution to the field of understanding documentation changes in Python projects. The methodology you have described is clear, comprehensive, and reproducible. I suggest some minor revisions to clarify a few points, such as providing more detail on the criteria used for function change detection and the specific functions that were analyzed in the dataset.\n\n   **Final Decision: Accept**\n\n   I look forward to seeing your revised manuscript and the potential contributions it will make to the field.\n\nBest regards,\n\nReviewer 20 (Distinguished Leader with Novice expertise)",

The flow diagram provided in Figure 2 is clear and helpful in understanding the overall process. The choice to select popular and actively maintained Python projects with a high star count and recent commit activity seems reasonable as it ensures the relevance of the data.\n\nHowever, I would like to offer some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. In the section \"For each selected project, we gather all associated Python source files,\" could you provide more details about how this is achieved? It might be helpful to include any specific tools or libraries used for this purpose.\n\n2. When using regular expressions to detect function definitions and docstrings, it would be useful to specify the exact regular expression pattern(s) employed. This will enable other researchers to replicate your work more easily.\n\n3. In the section \"Using PyDriller [8], a Python framework for mining Git,\" you mention that PyDriller can efficiently process Git data. It could be helpful to provide some quantitative data or examples on how this efficiency translates into the scale of the projects and commits you are dealing with.\n\n4. In the section \"We identified instances where the same function was modified in consecutive commits,\" it would be beneficial to elaborate more on how these consecutive updates are defined (e.g., time interval, number of commits).\n\n5. In the section \"Finally, we validated the extracted data using Python’s Tree-Sitter [10] and the function_parser package provided as part of the CodeSearchNet Challenge [11],\" it would be interesting to know how you chose between different parser options within these tools for your specific use case.\n\n6. In the section \"We then applied a 50-50 train-test split, based on a random selection of the curated projects,\" could you clarify what you mean by \"curated projects\"? Are these the projects that meet your initial criteria or are they the final selected projects after applying other filters?\n\nOverall, I find the methodology presented to be well-structured and comprehensive. However, addressing these suggestions will make it easier for readers to replicate your work and understand your choices more deeply.\n\n**Final Decision: Weak Accept**. Your paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field; however, I encourage you to address my suggestions for improved clarity and reproducibility before final publication.

The authors provide a clear and structured approach for selecting projects, gathering source files, analyzing commit history, and extracting relevant data points. They also discuss the use of various tools, such as PyDriller and Tree-Sitter, to facilitate this process.\n\nWhat makes this paper novel is its focus on capturing coupled changes between code and docstrings in Python functions. This is a specific and detailed aspect of programming language evolution that may not have been explored extensively before. The authors' attention to detail and their commitment to data quality are evident in the description of their methodology, which suggests that they have made significant contributions to this area.\n\nWhile it is possible that some of the individual components of this approach may be familiar or even based on existing work, the way the authors have integrated these components into a cohesive methodology makes the paper novel.",

The statement \"We began with a curated list of the top 200 Python projects on GitHub to ensure a diverse and representative sample\" is not supported by any information in the text.\n\n2. There is no mention of how the curated list of projects was selected, such as through certain criteria or methodologies.\n\n3. The text does state that the projects were selected based on their star count (to reflect popularity and community interest) and recent commit activity (to ensure the projects are actively maintained), but it does not provide any further information on how these factors were quantified or weighted.\n\n4. The text does mention using PyDriller to gather all associated Python source files for each selected project, but it does not specify what criteria were used to select which commits to include in the dataset.\n\n5. The statement \"We identified instances where the same function was modified in consecutive commits and recorded both the docstrings and code snippets from these commits\" is somewhat unclear; it would be more precise to say that they identified pairs of commits where changes to the same function were detected, but did not provide additional details on how this was done.\n\n6. The text does mention using regular expressions to detect function definitions, which is consistent with standard practices in natural language processing and information extraction tasks. However, it would be beneficial to include more specific information about the types of functions that were being analyzed (e.g., do they only consider Python functions with certain naming conventions or attributes?).\n\n7. The text does mention excluding data points where only the docstring or only the code had been altered, but this is a general statement and it would be helpful to provide more context on what specific types of changes were excluded.\n\n8. The text mentions using Tree-Sitter and Python's built-in `tree_sitter` library to validate the extracted data, which is correct; however, further information about how these tools were used to ensure the accuracy of the function names, docstrings, and corresponding code would be helpful.\n\n9. The statement \"To avoid duplication, in cases where multiple consecutive updates were made to the same function, we only included the first instance in our dataset\" seems unclear; it is not entirely clear what type of data points are being referred to here (e.g., do they mean commits that modify the same code or docstring?).\n\n10. The text does mention applying a 50-50 train-test split based on a random selection of the curated projects, which is standard practice in machine learning and data science tasks.\n\nOverall, while some of the details are missing from the provided text, it appears to be generally consistent with standard practices for collecting and preparing dataset for natural language processing or information extraction tasks.",

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI appreciate the comprehensive analysis presented in this paper regarding code and documentation changes within the CoDocBench dataset. The structure of the data and the insights drawn from it are well-organized and provide valuable insights into the relationship between function length, documentation length, and change frequencies.\n\nFirstly, I agree with Reviewer 1 that Figures 3a and 3b effectively illustrate the relationship between function length, code diff length, and docstring length. These visualizations help to validate the hypothesis that longer functions have longer diffs for both code and documentation.\n\nRegarding Figure 5, it would be helpful to include an explanation or interpretation of the results, as there seems to be less relation between the length of the code diff and the length of the docstring diff. It might be interesting to explore if this finding suggests that developers focus more on changing the functionality of larger functions without updating their documentation accordingly.\n\nI also appreciate Reviewer 1's comments regarding Figure 4 and the distribution of projects in the dataset. The lift chart effectively demonstrates the skewed nature of software data, with a small number of large projects accounting for a significant portion of samples. It would be worth mentioning in the discussion section if this has any implications on the generalizability of the findings or if it calls for further investigation into smaller projects.\n\nOverall, I believe this paper contributes valuable insights to the field and encourages further research into maintaining consistency in descriptive text as code evolves. In light of the positive aspects and areas for improvement mentioned above, I recommend a \"Weak Accept\" for this paper. I suggest considering Reviewer 1's recommendations for clarification on Figure 5 and addressing any potential implications of the project distribution on the findings.\n\nBest regards,\nReviewer 20 (Distinguished Leader with Novice expertise)",

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI appreciate the effort you've put into investigating the ability of large language models to comprehend and generate aligned updates in code-docstring pairs. The research questions are well-structured and address an interesting problem in the field of AI and software engineering.\n\nRegarding RQ1, I agree with Reviewer 1 that using edit distance as a metric is appropriate for comparing docstrings and code. However, it would be beneficial to provide more context on why edit distance is preferred over other metrics, especially when dealing with code. Furthermore, it might be interesting to see the distribution of the edit distances to better understand the performance of the models.\n\nIn RQ2, I find the approach taken for evaluating the model's ability to update code and docstrings reasonable. The use of the edit distance as a metric is also applicable here. However, it would be insightful to see how the different prompting strategies (Incorporating Contextual Information, 3-Shot Learning with BM25, Hybrid Strategy) impact the model's performance in this task. It seems like an interesting direction for future work.\n\nThe models you chose, Meta's Llama-3.1 and MistralAI's Mixtral, are indeed competitive in tasks related to code and natural language generation. I believe it would be valuable to discuss their specific strengths and weaknesses in the context of your research questions, as this could provide a more nuanced understanding of the models' performance.\n\nOverall, I find the paper to be well-written and the research questions to be relevant. The proposed methods are sound, and the choice of models is justified. I would recommend some additional discussion on the choice of edit distance and the impact of prompting strategies on performance.\n\n**Final Decision: Weak Accept**. With these revisions, the paper could make a valuable contribution to the field. However, I encourage you to further elaborate on the rationale behind your methodological choices and discuss the potential implications of different prompting strategies. Once these revisions are made, I believe the paper will be strong enough for publication.",
                "llama": " Dear Authors,\n\nThank you for submitting your paper on the investigation of large language models' ability to comprehend and generate aligned updates in code-docstring pairs. I found the research questions well-defined and the methods clearly outlined. The choice of using a competitive model like Llama-3.1 and MistralAI's Mixtral for the experiments adds credibility to your study.\n\nRegarding your research questions, I believe RQ1 is essential as it aims to evaluate the alignment between generated and reference code and docstrings. However, I would suggest adding a quantitative measure of success (other than edit distance) to provide more comprehensive results. For instance, you could include accuracy or F1 score based on the alignment.\n\nIn RQ2, the evaluation strategy seems sound; however, it would be beneficial to clarify if the edit distance is calculated only for the changed parts of the code or the entire code snippets. Also, consider discussing any potential limitations or challenges when using edit distance as the sole metric for evaluation.\n\nThe inclusion of different prompting strategies is an interesting addition to your study, and I appreciate the effort put into exploring their impact on performance. Incorporating contextual information seems particularly valuable, and it would be insightful to see the results compared to other strategies.\n\nMy minor concern is with the lack of discussion on potential biases that may arise due to the choice of projects or data sets for training and testing. Addressing this issue could strengthen your paper further.\n\nOverall, I find the study engaging and believe it contributes valuable insights to the field. I recommend a few adjustments as suggested above, but otherwise, I have no significant concerns that would prevent me from recommending a Weak Accept for publication.\n\nBest regards,\nReviewer 20\n(Strongly Recommend: Weak Accept)",
                "qwen": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have thoroughly reviewed your paper and I would like to provide some feedback that I hope will help you improve it further. Firstly, I appreciate the interesting research question you are addressing in this study: investigating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to comprehend and generate aligned updates in code-docstring pairs.\n\nYour research questions (RQ1 and RQ2) seem well-defined and appropriate for addressing your objectives. In RQ1, testing whether LLM-generated code and docstrings can correctly align with the reference old and new versions of code or docstrings is a crucial step towards understanding the model's capabilities in this area. Similarly, RQ2 requiring LLMs to effectively update code based on an updated docstring (and vice versa) helps evaluate the model's capacity to adapt to incremental changes.\n\nYour methodology appears robust with a variety of prompting strategies employed: incorporating contextual information, 3-shot learning with BM25, and hybrid strategy. Additionally, using relevant models like Instruct Turbo version of Meta’s Llama-3.1 and MixtralAI’s Mixtral for your experiments adds validity to your findings.\n\nOne suggestion I have is that it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or case studies in the paper to illustrate how the LLM performs when dealing with complex code changes and docstring updates, beyond just stating the edit distance between the generated and reference outputs. This will make the results easier for readers to grasp and understand their implications.\n\nLastly, it might be worth considering addressing some limitations or potential drawbacks of your approach, such as model overfitting, generalization issues, or possible biases that may arise in the LLM's generated code and docstrings. This will help provide a more balanced and comprehensive view of your research findings.\n\nOverall, I strongly believe this paper has significant merit and provides valuable insights into the capabilities of large language models in handling code-docstring pairs under incremental changes. I would recommend a strong accept for this work. Keep up the excellent research!\n\nBest regards,\nReviewer 20 (Distinguished Leader with Novice expertise)"
