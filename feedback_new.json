The proposed dataset, CoDocBench, seems to be a valuable resource for training and evaluating language models in tasks related to code documentation and maintenance.\n\nWhile the paper does not explicitly mention ASPLOS 2026 or its specific topics, its focus on software engineering, programming languages, and machine learning makes it relevant to the conference."

        "Feedback": "Accept.\n\nI have chosen \"Accept\" because, although the paper under consideration is not entirely novel, it presents new insights and contributions to a specific area of software engineering. Specifically, it proposes a new dataset, CoDocBench, aimed at training and evaluating language models in tasks related to helping developers better couple code and documentation changes.\n\nThe CoDocBench dataset appears to be novel because it focuses on the specific problem of supporting well-documented code changes, which is an under-explored area. The paper also proposes two initial tasks based on this dataset, which demonstrate its potential for improving the poorly-coupled Code-Documentation update rate reported by Schrek et al.\n\nWhile there are similarities between the proposed CoDocBench and other similar papers (e.g., DocuMint), such as CodeExp and Large Language Models LLMs bear great potential for automating tedious development tasks, these papers do not appear to focus on this specific aspect of code documentation. Therefore, I consider the CoDocBench proposal novel because it addresses a unique challenge in software maintenance.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the paper does build upon existing research and introduces new ideas and approaches, such as the use of machine learning classifiers for maintaining traceability information in systems (TRAIL). The novelty lies in the specific application of these ideas to the problem of supporting well-documented code changes.",

        "Feedback": "[Reject]\n\nSpecific corrections:\n\n1. I was unable to find any reliable source supporting the claim that software maintenance activities consume 60-80% of overall software budgets.\n\n2. The reference [6] is unverifiable and does not appear to be a credible source for the claim about documentation practice in industry needing improvement and maintenance difficulties arising as a result.\n\n3. I couldn't find any information on Schreck et al.'s work that supports the specific claim that Docstrings are updated only around 33% of the time that code is changed.\n\n4. While the introduction of CoDocBench seems plausible, it would be beneficial to provide more context or evidence about its goals and methodology.\n\nMy take on the facts: The text appears to present a hypothetical approach to improving software maintenance by leveraging language models. However, several claims are not supported by reliable sources, casting doubt on the accuracy of the information presented.",
