As Reviewer 13, I'll provide my feedback on the manuscript.\n\nFirstly, I appreciate the authors' efforts to tackle a significant challenge in time series modeling, which is the need to retain long-range memory in Neural ODEs. The proposed approach, PolyODE, seems promising, and I'm excited to see how it addresses this limitation.\n\nOne aspect that caught my attention is the way the authors highlight the practical challenges in learning PolyODE. They discuss the difficulties in adapting solvers for ODEs, which is a crucial step in training these models. By acknowledging these challenges, the authors demonstrate their understanding of the complexities involved in working with Neural ODEs.\n\nI also appreciate the theoretical bounds provided by the authors to characterize the quality of reconstruction when using PolyODE. This adds depth to the manuscript and provides valuable insights into the performance of the proposed model.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns regarding the evaluation section. While the authors present several downstream tasks and evaluate the performance of their approach, I think they could strengthen their analysis by providing more detailed explanations of the results and potential limitations.

                "qwen2.5": "Sure, let's dive into this section. Overall, it does a great job setting up the context for neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and highlighting their utility in time series modeling.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to understand this paper about Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and their application in time series analysis. The authors propose something called PolyODE, which is based on orthogonal polynomial basis functions. Let me break down what I know and try to figure out if this makes sense.\n\nFirst, the introduction mentions that time series data is common in healthcare, finance, etc., but it's challenging because of its temporal nature and high dimensionality. Traditional approaches convert time series into vectors capturing local and global structures, using methods like RNNs or Transformers. The paper focuses on Neural ODEs as a solution for their flexibility and ability to handle irregularly sampled data.\n\nNeural ODEs are interesting because they model the continuous dynamics of the data between observed points. This is good for irregular sampling. However, the main issue the paper addresses is that these models can lose memory of past states, which is called being amnesic. The authors propose a fix by using orthogonal polynomials to parameterize the dynamics function, ensuring that the model retains information from both recent and distant past.\n\nLooking at their method, they use an adaptive ODE solver with their PolyODE approach. They also provide theoretical bounds on reconstruction quality and test their model on chaotic time series and real-world patient data in ICUs.\n\nThe strengths I see are addressing a significant limitation (being amnesic) in Neural ODEs by enforcing long-term memory through polynomial basis functions, which sounds logical. The experimental setup with both synthetic and real data also seems solid for validating the approach.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit concerned about how they enforce orthogonality and whether this could limit model flexibility. Also, do orthogonal polynomials cover all possible dynamics adequately? And what about computational efficiency when using adaptive solvers?\n\nOverall, their contribution seems valuable in improving the capabilities of Neural ODEs for time series tasks by addressing a key limitation.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an important challenge in Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) regarding their amnesic nature, proposing a novel approach called PolyODE that incorporates orthogonal polynomial basis functions to retain long-term memory. Here's a structured evaluation of the paper:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Addressing Amnesia**: The authors effectively tackle the limitation of Neural ODEs losing historical information by enforcing long-range memory through their dynamics function parameterization. This is a significant contribution as it enhances the model's ability to handle time series data with both recent and distant past dependencies.\n\n2. **Orthogonal Polynomials**: Utilizing orthogonal polynomials provides an orthogonal basis, which theoretically supports better stability and conditioning in numerical integration. This could improve computational efficiency and accuracy when using adaptive solvers.\n\n3. **Theoretical Bounds and Experimental Validation**: The paper includes theoretical bounds on reconstruction quality and empirical validation on both synthetic and real-world data (ICU patient data), demonstrating improved performance over existing models.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Orthogonality Enforcement**: It's important to critically assess whether the orthogonality of the polynomial basis introduces constraints that limit model flexibility. Exploring how this choice affects different types of time series dynamics could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: The use of adaptive solvers with PolyODE might introduce computational overhead. Investigating potential optimizations or trade-offs could provide practical insights into implementation feasibility.\n\n3. **Polynomial Basis Adequacy**: It's crucial to evaluate if orthogonal polynomials sufficiently capture the complexity of real-world time series, especially in diverse domains like healthcare where data can be highly variable and non-linear.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper makes a substantial contribution by enhancing Neural ODEs' ability to retain long-term information through PolyODE. While there are areas for further exploration regarding the practicality and limitations of their approach, the methodological innovations effectively address a key limitation in the field. Therefore, the paper should be accepted as it advances both theoretical understanding and practical applications in time series analysis with Neural ODEs."

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper about time series modeling in machine learning. The abstract mentions something called PolyODEs, which is a new approach using orthogonal polynomials for continuous-time models. Hmm, from the section I read, it says that ODE-based models like Neural CDE and ODE-LSTM use differential equations to model how data changes over time, which is good for irregularly sampled data because they can handle unobserved time points.\n\nWait, so if these ODEs are already being used successfully in methods like ODE-RNN or ODE-LSTM, why do they need PolyODEs? The abstract says that PolyODEs use orthogonal polynomials to parameterize the dynamics function. I remember from my studies that orthogonal polynomials can be useful for approximating functions because they have nice properties, like being independent and minimizing error in certain ways.\n\nBut then it also mentions that existing methods already use ODE solvers during training and inference, which might make PolyODEs less necessary if those are working fine. Unless the new approach offers something better. Maybe by using a specific set of orthogonal polynomials, they can improve how well the model reconstructs past data or forecasts future points.\n\nI'm also thinking about memory in RNNs. I know GRUs and LSTMs were designed to handle long-term dependencies better than standard RNNs. How does that relate here? Maybe PolyODEs address a similar issue but for continuous-time models instead of discrete ones. \n\nThe abstract says that recent approaches using orthogonal polynomials like LMUs, HiPPO, or S4 have their own issues with reconstruction accuracy and computational performance. So if PolyODEs fix those problems, they could be better.\n\nBut does the model's use of differential equations make it inherently more complex? Solving ODEs numerically can be computationally expensive, but maybe the new parameterization makes it faster or more accurate in certain cases.\n\nI'm also curious about how this compares to other continuous-time models. For instance, are there any benchmarks where PolyODEs perform better than existing methods like Neural CDE or ODE-LSTM?\n\nAnother thing I'm thinking is whether the introduction of orthogonal polynomials adds much value beyond what's already known with differential equations in modeling time series. It might be incremental but could still offer improvements if properly implemented.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that PolyODEs are a novel approach using orthogonal polynomials to enhance ODE-based models for better handling of irregularly sampled data and accurate reconstruction/prediction. The abstract suggests they address limitations found in existing methods, so they have potential value if their methodology is solid and validated through experiments.\n</think>\n\nPolyODEs represent an innovative approach that combines orthogonal polynomials with ODE-based models to improve the handling of irregularly sampled time series data. By leveraging differential equations, these models can effectively model continuous-time processes, which is particularly advantageous for sparse or irregular data points. The integration of orthogonal polynomials may offer a novel parameterization that enhances the dynamics function, potentially improving reconstruction accuracy and memory efficiency.\n\nWhile existing methods like ODE-RNN and ODE-LSTM already utilize numerical solvers for differential equations, PolyODEs introduce an alternative framework using orthogonal polynomials. This approach could address limitations identified in previous models, such as poor reconstruction or computational inefficiency, if the methodology is well-implemented and validated through rigorous testing.\n\nIn summary, PolyODEs show promise by building upon established ODE-based techniques with a new parameterization that might offer improvements in specific scenarios, particularly for tasks requiring accurate future forecasting and past reconstruction. However, their effectiveness will depend on further validation and comparison with existing methods like Neural CDE and ODE-LSTM.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to understand this paper about using orthogonal polynomial projections for modeling time-varying processes with neural differential equations. Let me break down what's presented here.\n\nFirst, the paper starts by defining orthogonal polynomials with respect to a measure \u00b5. They mention that these polynomials are orthogonal in the sense that their inner product is non-zero only when they're the same degree. That makes sense\u2014orthogonal polynomials have this property where each polynomial of degree n is orthogonal to all others except itself.\n\nThen, they simplify by considering measures absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, which means there's a weight function involved. Examples given are Legendre, Hermite, and Laguerre polynomials, so that part I'm somewhat familiar with\u2014they're common in numerical integration and approximation theory.\n\nThe paper talks about projecting a 1D process f onto the space of polynomials of degree N, resulting in f_N(t). They express this projection as a sum of orthogonal polynomials multiplied by coefficients c_n. These coefficients are calculated using an inner product involving the weight function. The projection is optimal under the measure \u00b5, so it minimizes some distance metric.\n\nMoving on, they discuss updating these projections continuously as new observations come in. Instead of recalculating everything from scratch each time, which would be computationally expensive, they model how the coefficients c_n(t) evolve over time using differential equations. Specifically, equation (4) shows that the derivative of the coefficient vector is a linear combination involving matrices A and B.\n\nThey mention that Gu et al. used this to set up a dynamic system where the coefficients can be updated sequentially with each new sample. This seems efficient because you don't need to store all past data\u2014it's handled in real-time as each time step comes in.\n\nHowever, when they present their approach compared to Gu et al., there are two main differences: using continuous time instead of discrete and jointly modeling d-dimensional processes with memory banks via orthogonal projections embedded in a Neural ODE. \n\nI'm a bit concerned about the practicality here. Using differential equations for coefficients might require smoothness assumptions that aren't always met by real-world data, which can be noisy or have abrupt changes. Also, I wonder how they handle varying weights over time since \u00b5_t is time-dependent. If \u00b5_t has arbitrary shapes, finding or maintaining orthogonal polynomials could become computationally intensive.\n\nAnother point is the integration of multiple dimensions into a single ODE model with memory banks. This seems complex because each dimension would potentially have its own dynamics and interactions. Ensuring that these are handled efficiently within an RNN framework might be challenging, especially in terms of computational resources.\n\nThe idea of using orthogonal projections as memory banks is interesting for maintaining relevant information over time without storing all past data. But I'm not sure how the selection of basis functions affects this\u2014choosing different measures or weight functions could change what parts of the process are emphasized more heavily.\n\nThey mention that their approach avoids storing all temporal information, which aligns with resource efficiency but might limit interpretability since each projection is a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials. It's unclear how much information is lost in this projection compared to storing all data points or using another method like wavelet transforms for sparse representations.\n\nAdditionally, the use of RNNs combined with ODEs introduces another layer that could lead to overfitting if not properly regularized. The joint modeling aspect might require careful tuning of hyperparameters and a sufficiently expressive model architecture to capture complex temporal dependencies without losing necessary information.\n\nIn summary, while the approach seems theoretically sound, practical implementation raises concerns about computational efficiency, smoothness assumptions, handling multiple dimensions, and maintaining interpretability. I\u2019d want more details on how these challenges are addressed in their experimental setup.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe paper presents an innovative approach to modeling time-varying processes using orthogonal polynomial projections within a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. Here's a structured summary of the evaluation:\n\n1. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper builds on well-established concepts of orthogonal polynomials and their properties, providing a clear mathematical foundation for projecting continuous-time processes.\n\n2. **Dynamic Coefficient Update**: By modeling coefficient evolution with linear dynamics, the approach offers an efficient method to sequentially update projections as new data arrives without storing all past observations.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Smoothness**: The use of continuous time models is a strength, though it may require smoothness assumptions that aren't always met in real-world scenarios.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Dimensions**: The joint modeling of d-dimensional processes with orthogonal projections embedded in a Neural ODE framework introduces complexity but offers a novel approach to efficiently handle multiple dimensions.\n\n5. **Potential Challenges**: Concerns about computational efficiency, smoothness assumptions, and handling arbitrary weight functions are valid but addressable within the theoretical framework provided.\n\n6. **Comparative Advantages**: The approach avoids storing all temporal information, aligning with resource efficiency, though it may impact interpretability.\n\n**Conclusion**: While practical implementation details are crucial for assessing applicability, the paper's theoretical contributions and methodological innovations are commendable and provide a solid basis for further exploration."

            "Test": "This appears to be a formalization of a problem related to time series embedding and prediction. Here's a summary of the setup:\n\n**Problem Context**\n\nWe are given a collection of sequences of temporal observations `x = {(xi, mi, ti) : i \u2208 {1, ..., T}}`, where each sequence consists of observed values `xi` with corresponding masks `mi` that indicate which dimensions are observed at each time point `ti`. The mask `mi` is a binary vector where `mi,j = 1` if the jth dimension is observed and `mi,j = 0` otherwise.\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe goal is to develop an embedding function that maps each sequence `x` to a vector `h \u2208 Rd` such that:\n\n1. **Reverse Reconstruction**: The embedded vector `h` retains as much information as possible from the original sequence `x`. This is formalized through the objective of minimizing the distance between the reverse reconstruction `x\u0302<t` (predicted values prior to time `t`) and the observed portion `x<t`.\n2. **Downstream Task Performance**: The embedded vector `h` should provide better performance for downstream prediction tasks, such as predicting an auxiliary vector `y` drawn from an unknown distribution depending on `x`. This is formalized through the objective of maximizing the expected performance metric `\u21b5(y\u0302(x), y)`.\n\n**Formalization**\n\nThe problem is formalized using a distance metric `d(x, x0) = 1T \u2211i kxi \u22c5 x0ik`, which measures the difference between two time series at all times. The objective functions are:\n\n* **Reverse Reconstruction**: `ht` enjoys more memory than `h0t` if `d(x\u0302<t,x<t) < d(x\u03020<t,x<t)`.\n* **Downstream Task Performance**: `ht` is more informative than `h0t` if `Ex,y[\u21b5(y\u0302(x),y)] > Ex,y[\u21b5(y\u0302(x)0,y)]`.\n\nOverall, the problem seeks to develop an embedding function that balances two competing objectives: preserving information from the original sequence and providing better performance for downstream prediction tasks.",

I have carefully reviewed your \"Problem Setup\" section and I find it well-structured and clear in its presentation of the problem at hand. The definitions provided for the sequences of observations (x), masks (mi), and distance between two time series (d) are concise and easy to understand.\n\nThe goals you have set for your research, namely embedding a sequence into a vector that retains a maximal amount of information while being informative for downstream prediction tasks, are clearly stated and well-articulated. The objectives you've outlined, namely long memory representation (Objective 1) and downstream task performance (Objective 2), are logical extensions of the problem statement and provide a solid foundation for your research.\n\nI particularly appreciate the formalization of reverse reconstruction (x\u0302<t) and how it is used to evaluate the long memory representation of an embedding (Objective 1). This approach seems sound and should allow for an effective comparison between different embeddings. The use of a performance metric (\u21b5) for Objective 2, which compares the predictions obtained from two different embeddings based on an auxiliary vector y drawn from an unknown distribution depending on x, is also well thought out.\n\nHowever, I would like to make a few suggestions that might help improve the clarity and robustness of your research:\n\n1. It might be beneficial to provide a brief explanation or justification for why you have chosen PT as the norm used in the distance calculation (d(x,x0)). This could help readers understand the rationale behind your choice.\n2. While you've defined the mask mi, it would be helpful to mention how it is generated or determined. Is it manually created, based on a certain rule, or learned from data?\n3. In Objective 2, it might be worth discussing the potential limitations and challenges associated with using an auxiliary vector y drawn from an unknown distribution depending on x. This could help provide context for readers who may not be familiar with this approach.\n4. You've mentioned that the number of observations for each sequence (T) can vary across sequences. It would be useful to discuss how this variability is handled in your research, as it could impact both objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, I find your paper to be well-written and clear, with a solid problem setup and well-defined objectives.

                "llama3.2": "I'll begin by saying that I appreciate the effort to formalize the problem setup and objectives in this paper. The authors have provided a clear and concise explanation of their approach, which is essential for any technical work.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the clarity with which they've defined key concepts such as reverse reconstruction, long memory representation, and downstream task performance. These definitions will undoubtedly aid in understanding the contributions of this paper.\n\nUpon reviewing the objectives, I noticed that Objective 1 (Long memory representation) relies heavily on the concept of distance d(x\u0302<t,x<t), which seems to be used in a way that might be sensitive to scale. For example, the condition for ht enjoying more memory than h0t is based on whether this distance is smaller, but without knowing how distances are normalized or what their range is, it's challenging to interpret this result.\n\nConsidering this potential challenge with Objective 1, I would suggest exploring how to normalize these distances in a way that accounts for scale. This might involve incorporating the maximum possible value of d(x\u0302<t,x<t) as a scaling factor when evaluating differences between ht and h0t. Alternatively, the authors could explore techniques like normalization or standardization for their distance metric to better handle varying scales.\n\nMoving on to Objective 2 (Downstream task performance), I notice that the paper relies heavily on an external performance metric \u21b5. While this is a practical approach, it's worth considering whether there might be more informative ways to evaluate the effectiveness of ht versus h0t directly through their impact on downstream predictions.\n\nAnother suggestion for improvement could involve exploring potential biases in the distribution of y or how to ensure that y\u0302(x) and y\u0302(x0) are drawn from distributions that accurately represent the task at hand. It's also worth considering whether there might be other, more effective methods to evaluate the informative power of ht versus h0t.\n\nIn terms of overall quality, I think this paper presents a solid foundation for exploring the relationship between embedding sequences and downstream prediction tasks.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper's Problem Setup section. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they define a collection of sequences where each sequence x consists of time-stamped observations and masks. Each observation has xi, which is in Rd, mi indicating presence/absence across dimensions, and ti the timestamp. The distance metric d(x,x0) is given as 1 over T times the sum of squared differences for each dimension at each time point.\n\nThe main goal is to embed a sequence x into a vector h that retains maximal information and is good for downstream tasks like prediction. \n\nFor Objective 1, they talk about reverse reconstruction: using an embedding ht to predict past values up to t-1 (xhatt). The idea is that if the distance between xhatt and x<t is small, then ht captures more of the sequence's structure.\n\nThen there's Objective 2 about downstream performance. They say ht is better than h0t if predictions yhatt are better than yhat0 in expectation.\n\nWait, but I'm confused about how these two objectives interact. Is it possible that a model that remembers long-term dependencies (more memory) might not perform as well on prediction tasks? Also, the distance metric seems to be averaged over all time points, which could give equal weight to recent and past data. \n\nI also wonder if they've considered alternative approaches, like using recurrent neural networks or attention mechanisms for sequence modeling, which are commonly used for time series analysis. Maybe their embedding method doesn't leverage these effectively.\n\nAnother point is whether the reverse reconstruction accurately captures the necessary information without overfitting, especially when the number of training sequences is limited. If the embeddings are too complex, they might not generalize well.\n\nI'm also thinking about how to measure if an embedding actually retains meaningful information or just noise. Without a validation step on downstream tasks during training, it's hard to assess if the objective function used in learning h aligns with actual prediction needs.\n\nLastly, does their definition of memory adequately capture all types of temporal dependencies? It seems focused on predicting past data from current embeddings, but maybe future data should also be considered for certain applications.\n</think>\n\nThe Problem Setup section introduces an embedding method for time series data aimed at maximizing information retention and improving downstream prediction tasks. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Objective 1: Long Memory Representation**\n   - The concept of \"memory\" is defined through reverse reconstruction, where embeddings are used to predict past values.\n   - This objective emphasizes capturing long-term dependencies by ensuring that predictions of prior data points (xhatt) closely match the actual historical data (x<t).\n   - However, there's a potential issue with the distance metric being averaged over all time points. This might give equal weight to recent and past data, potentially overlooking nuanced temporal patterns.\n\n2. **Objective 2: Downstream Task Performance**\n   - The goal here is for the embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy on unseen data.\n   - The paper suggests using an auxiliary variable y for evaluation, but there's no mention of integrating this into the training process or validation steps, leaving room for concern about alignment between objectives.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis with Alternative Approaches**\n   - The discussion could benefit from comparing the proposed method with established techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or attention mechanisms commonly used in time series analysis.\n   - This comparison would help validate whether the new approach offers significant advantages over existing methods.\n\n4. **Validation and Overfitting Concerns**\n   - There's a need for validation steps during training to ensure that embeddings generalize well, particularly with limited data.\n   - The risk of overfitting is real if the model becomes too complex in capturing embedded information without considering generalization.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Measurement of Information Retention**\n   - It's important to have mechanisms to measure whether the embedding retains meaningful and necessary information without being misled by noise or irrelevant details.\n   - This could involve separate validation metrics focused on information preservation versus prediction accuracy.\n\n6. **Consideration of Temporal Dependencies**\n   - The definition of memory might need expansion to include future data in certain applications, ensuring that the method is versatile across different use cases.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the paper introduces an innovative approach to embedding time series data with defined objectives for both long-term memory and downstream prediction, it could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation framework. Comparing against existing methods and validating the model's ability to generalize would strengthen its contribution to the field. Additionally, ensuring that the measurement of information retention and temporal dependencies is thorough would address potential gaps in capturing necessary patterns."

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper's contribution. It seems like they're combining orthogonal polynomials with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to model time series data. The idea is that by augmenting the state space with coefficients of orthogonal polynomials, their model can retain long-term memory better.\n\nFirst, I think about how this approach differs from standard Neural ODEs. Orthogonal polynomials are used here as a way to capture more complex dynamics because they form a basis for function approximation. By including these in the hidden state, maybe the model can learn richer representations of the underlying process generating the time series.\n\nThey mention that h(t) is structured with h0(t) and other hi(t), each corresponding to different aspects of the system's evolution. The readout function gi seems straightforward\u2014just picking out specific components from h(t). So for a d-dimensional input x, they have d separate models each processing one dimension through their own set of equations.\n\nLooking at Eq. 6, it breaks down into two parts: the update step and the integration step. During the integration phase, they're solving differential equations that involve both the coefficients c(t) (from orthogonal polynomials) and the hidden state h0(t). This coupling could allow the model to use both local information from the input x(t) and global dynamics captured by h0(t).\n\nOne thing I'm wondering about is how this affects computational efficiency. Each dimension seems to have its own separate system, which might multiply the computation time for high-dimensional data. Also, since they're using orthogonal polynomials as part of the state, there could be issues with exploding or vanishing gradients in those components.\n\nThe update step after each observation at ti is interesting. They mention setting hj(ti) := cj(ti) and h0(ti)j := xi,j for observed dimensions. This suggests that upon receiving a new data point, they're updating both the coefficients of the polynomials (c(t)) and directly reading out the input x into h0(t). But I'm not sure how this handles missing or irregularly sampled observations\u2014does it work well with varying time steps?\n\nAnother point is about future work: they mention that tracking N coefficients per time series dimension might be memory-intensive. Maybe using techniques like dimensionality reduction on c(t) could help, but the paper doesn't explore that yet.\n\nI'm also thinking about how this model compares to other models that use similar approaches, like extension fields in neural ODEs or other memory-augmented models. It would be good to see some empirical comparisons showing the benefits over existing methods.\n\nIn terms of implementation, solving a system of differential equations for each dimension might require careful tuning of the neural network's architecture and training procedures to ensure stable gradients. Also, choosing appropriate basis functions (orthogonal polynomials) could influence how well the model captures different types of dynamics.\n\nOverall, the idea of augmenting Neural ODEs with orthogonal polynomial coefficients seems innovative. It could provide a way to capture both local and global patterns in time series data more effectively than traditional approaches. However, practical considerations like computational efficiency, handling irregular observations, and memory constraints need further exploration. The paper's contribution is promising but might benefit from addressing these aspects in future work.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes an innovative approach by augmenting Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with coefficients of orthogonal polynomials to enhance the model's ability to retain long-term memory and capture complex dynamics in time series data. The key contributions include structuring the hidden state h(t) into components that handle both local observations and global dynamics, using readout functions to project specific aspects of the system's evolution.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Enhanced Expressivity:** The integration of orthogonal polynomials allows for a richer representation of time series data by capturing diverse dynamic patterns.\n2. **Structured Hidden State:** The model's architecture divides h(t) into components, each handling different aspects\u2014h0(t) for Neural ODE dynamics and c(t) as memory banks, facilitating both local and global information processing.\n\n**Considerations:**\n1. **Computational Efficiency:** Separate systems per dimension may increase computational complexity, especially for high-dimensional data.\n2. **Handling Irregular Observations:** The update step's approach to setting h0(ti)j := xi,j might not effectively manage irregularly sampled or missing data.\n3. **Memory Constraints:** Tracking multiple coefficients could be memory-intensive; potential solutions like dimensionality reduction are suggested but not explored.\n\n**Comparison with Existing Models:**\nThe paper lacks direct comparisons with other models that augment ODEs, such as extension fields, which could highlight its unique advantages and limitations more clearly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the proposed method shows promise in capturing complex dynamics and memory retention, practical challenges like computational efficiency and handling irregular data need further investigation. Addressing these aspects alongside exploring memory reduction techniques could solidify the model's effectiveness.\n\nFinal Decision:\nAccept"

            "Test": "This text appears to describe a machine learning architecture for predicting and reconstructing time series data using an iterative process called PolyODE. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe PolyODE architecture is designed to minimize the reconstruction error between predicted values and observed values. The training process involves alternating between integration steps (where the system is integrated forward in time) and update steps (where the model is updated with new observations).\n\n**Numerical Integration**\n\nOne technical challenge in PolyODE is integrating stiff systems, which can be unstable when using explicit solvers. To address this, an implicit solver such as Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton is used.\n\n**Reverse Reconstruction**\n\nThe reverse reconstruction of a time series at any time t can be computed using Equation 9. This involves computing the projection coefficients part of the hidden process and using them to reconstruct the original time series.\n\n**Error Bounds**\n\nThe error between the predicted values (x\u0302) and reconstructed values (x\u0302<t) is bounded above, as shown in Result 4.1. The bound depends on various parameters, including the degree of polynomial approximation (N), the Lipschitz constant of the forward process, and the cumulative absolute error (SK).\n\n**Optimization**\n\nThe PolyODE architecture jointly minimizes both global reconstruction and global reconstruction error. When SK = 0, this result corresponds to the well-known projection error for orthogonal polynomials projection of continuous processes.\n\n**Hyperparameter Tuning**\n\nIncreasing the width of the weighting function (i.e., the interval [t, t]) can increase the reconstruction error, but this can be compensated by increasing the dimension of the polynomial basis accordingly. The Lipschitz constant of the temporal process also affects the reverse reconstruction abilities for high-frequency components.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n1. PolyODE is a machine learning architecture designed to predict and reconstruct time series data.\n2. The training process involves alternating between integration steps and update steps.\n3. Numerical integration can be unstable with explicit solvers, but implicit solvers can address this challenge.\n4. Reverse reconstruction is possible using Equation 9.\n5. Error bounds are provided for the difference between predicted values and reconstructed values.\n\nOverall, PolyODE appears to be a robust architecture for predicting and reconstructing time series data, with a focus on minimizing reconstruction error.",

                "llama3.2": "Thank you for sharing this paper with me. As Reviewer 13, I've taken a close look at the contents and I'm pleased to see that the authors have made a concerted effort to address some of the concerns raised by previous reviewers.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to commend the authors on their use of numerical integration techniques to tackle stiff dynamical systems. The choice of using an implicit solver such as Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton is a good one, and it's reassuring to see that they've taken steps to mitigate the instability issues associated with explicit solvers.\n\nHowever, I do have some concerns about the presentation of certain concepts. For instance, I think the authors could benefit from providing more context about the technical challenges posed by stiff systems and how they're addressed in this paper. While the discussion on the stiffness ratio and its implications is clear, it might be helpful to provide more background information for readers who are not familiar with these concepts.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to see more clarity around the initialization of the hidden processes. The authors mention that the initial values can be initialized with static information, but they don't provide much detail on how this works in practice. It would be beneficial to include more examples or explanations to illustrate how this affects the overall performance of the model.\n\nAnother area where I think the paper could improve is in providing more results and comparisons with other methods. While the authors present some interesting findings, such as the bound on the mean square error between forward and reverse predictions, it would be helpful to see more robust evaluations and comparisons with established baseline models or other polyode-based approaches.\n\nFinally, I'd like to suggest that the authors consider providing more context about the theoretical foundations of their approach. While they mention some relevant results from Canuto and Quarteroni (1982), it might be beneficial to provide a more in-depth discussion on the underlying mathematical framework and how it relates to the practical implementation.\n\nIn terms of clarity, coherence, and overall flow, I think the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors have done a good job of breaking down complex concepts into manageable sections, and the use of notation and definitions is generally clear.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the paper could improve, I believe that this is a solid contribution to the field of polyode-based modeling. With some further development and refinement, I think it has the potential to make a meaningful impact on our understanding of complex systems and their dynamics.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept",
                "qwen2.5": "Sure, I'll take a look at this section! Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Training Procedure\n\nThe training process described in the paper is clear and logical. You start with initializing hidden processes \\(c(0) = 0\\) and \\(h(0) = 0\\), which can be updated using static information if available. The loss function is then calculated at each observation time, and you alternate between integration steps and update steps. This approach makes sense for capturing the dynamics of your system.\n\n### Numerical Integration\n\nThe section on numerical integration is well-explained. You highlight that the system is stiff due to its linear inhomogeneous nature and use implicit solvers like Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton to handle this challenge. The explanation about the stiffness ratio growing with polynomial approximation degree \\(N\\) and the instability at large integration step sizes is helpful for understanding why implicit methods are necessary.\n\n### Algorithm 1\n\nThe pseudo-code provided in Algorithm 1 is clear and well-structured, showing how the training process unfolds over time. It outlines the steps clearly: integrating hidden processes from one observation to the next, updating them based on new observations, and accumulating the loss at each step. The integration and update steps are nicely interleaved.\n\n### Forecasting and Reverse Reconstruction\n\nThe forecasting method is straightforward. Using the learned model in the integration step, you can forecast future values at an arbitrary time \\(t^*\\). The reverse reconstruction process is explained with a formula that leverages projection coefficients from the hidden processes. This approach ensures that the error between forward and reverse reconstructions is bounded by a specific expression.\n\n### Error Bound\n\nThe error bound provided in Result 4.1 is quite detailed, which is good for theoretical grounding. It acknowledges the dependency on various factors like the degree of polynomial approximation \\(N\\), the Lipschitz constant \\(L\\), and the cumulative absolute errors \\(SK\\). The key insight here is that as the approximation gets better (increasing \\(N\\)), the reconstruction error diminishes, aligning well with the training objective.\n\n### Overall\n\nYour architecture indeed jointly minimizes both global reconstruction and global reconstruction error, which is a strong point. The fact that the bound reduces to the known projection error for orthogonal polynomials in certain cases adds credibility to your approach.\n\n### Minor Suggestions\n\n1. **Clarification on Initialization:** While initializing hidden processes with static information is noted, it might be useful to provide more details or examples of when this would be applicable.\n2. **Stiffness Ratio Clarification:** Could you perhaps add a brief example or visualization showing how the stiffness ratio changes as \\(N\\) increases? This could help readers understand why high-degree approximations lead to increased instability.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that all technical points are clearly explained, and the approach is well-founded theoretically, I'm inclined to support the paper. The minor suggestions mentioned can be addressed in future revisions.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nFeel free to add any additional comments or clarifications if needed!",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to review this paper. The section provided is about training an architecture using a loss function based on reconstruction error. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe authors mention they're minimizing the squared difference between predictions and observations, which makes sense for regression tasks. They initialize hidden states with zeros but note that static information can be used if available. That seems reasonable as well.\n\nThey alternate integration steps and update steps at observation times. The loss is updated each time an observation comes in. Using a pseudo-code helps with understanding the procedure. I like seeing algorithm descriptions because they clarify how things work step by step.\n\nThe part about numerical integration stands out. They use differentiable solvers from Chen et al., which is good for gradient-based training. But then they talk about stiffness issues, specifically that the system's eigenvalues have a large stiffness ratio when N increases. This can cause instabilities with explicit solvers because of large step sizes.\n\nThey mention using implicit solvers like Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton to handle this instability. I know implicit methods are good for stiff problems, so this makes sense. They also reference Sauer (2011), which is a reliable source on numerical methods.\n\nLooking at the algorithm, it initializes hidden states and then integrates from t_prev until ti, updates the states with observations, adds to loss, and repeats. The forecasting part uses an integral of h(s)ds multiplied by some function \u2713(h). It's a bit unclear without more context, but I'll assume it's manageable.\n\nThe reverse reconstruction formula is also given, which projects future states back. The error bound they derive seems complex but logical, involving terms like K (number of observations), L (Lipschitz constant), and N (polynomial degree). It shows that as N increases or SK decreases, the error bound improves, which aligns with optimization goals.\n\nThey also mention that when SK=0, it reduces to orthogonal projection errors from Canuto and Quarteroni, so they're connecting to known results. That's a good sign of building on existing work.\n\nOne thing I'm not sure about is how sensitive their method is to parameter choices like the weighting function width . The error increases with , which might limit practical use unless compensated by increasing N or L. But that's probably inherent to polynomial approximations.\n\nThe paper seems well-structured, clear, and rigorous mathematically. It also connects to previous work, which adds depth. However, I'm concerned about how they handle the weighting function width  in practice since it affects reconstruction error predictably. Maybe they should explore adaptive widths or ways to mitigate this sensitivity without too much overhead.\n\nThe numerical experiments part isn't included here, so I can't assess if their approach works empirically. But the theoretical framework and algorithm design look solid. If the code is available, I'd want to run some simulations to confirm these findings.\n\nOverall, while there's room for improvement in handling parameters like , the paper presents a strong method with good theoretical underpinnings. If they address those concerns in experiments or sensitivity analyses, it would strengthen their submission.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe paper presents a well-structured approach to training an architecture using reconstruction error as a loss function, addressing both forward and reverse predictions. The numerical integration strategy for handling stiff systems is appropriately chosen with implicit solvers. The theoretical bounds on reconstruction errors are logically derived and connect to existing work. While there's room for improvement in parameter sensitivity, the method is solid with good theoretical foundation. If supplementary experiments confirm empirical effectiveness, this paper would be a valuable contribution."

The stiffness ratio grows large with the degree of polynomial approximation N due to the increasing complexity of the system.\n\nIncreasing the width of the weighting function (increasing ) predictably results in higher reconstruction error because a larger weight is placed on more frequent or high-frequency components, which can lead to overfitting and reduced generalization ability.

                "llama3.2": "Thank you for sharing this paper with me. As Reviewer 13, I'll be providing a diplomatic and constructive feedback on the paper.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to commend the authors on their comprehensive approach to evaluating the PolyODE model on various time series datasets. The scope of the study is quite broad, covering synthetic univariate, chaotic attractors, MIMIC-III dataset, and ablation studies. This indicates that the authors have put in significant effort to validate the model's performance across different scenarios.\n\nOne aspect I'd like to highlight is the use of Poisson point process to generate irregularly sampled time series for the synthetic dataset. This is an excellent way to simulate real-world scenarios where data points are not uniformly distributed, which can be a common challenge in many time series analysis tasks.\n\nRegarding the baselines, I appreciate how the authors have compared PolyODE with Neural ODEs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) architectures designed for long-term memory. This comparison provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. However, I'd like to suggest that the authors consider using more recent variants of these baselines, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have shown promise in capturing complex temporal dynamics.\n\nIn terms of the ablation study, I think it's excellent that the authors are exploring the importance of leveraging the neural network to learn the dynamics of the time series. The results from Table 3 suggest that PolyODE outperforms linear and constant interpolation schemes significantly, which is consistent with my expectations. However, I'd like to see more analysis on how the choice of interpolation scheme affects the downstream classification task. For instance, what about using polynomial or radial basis function (RBF) interpolation?\n\nAnother aspect worth discussing is the incorporation of global time series uncertainty into PolyODE. While it's great that the authors have demonstrated this capability, I'd like to see more exploration on how this can be further improved. What are some potential techniques for estimating and incorporating uncertainty in the model? How might these improvements impact downstream tasks?\n\nLastly, I think the paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the Equation 9 used for reverse reconstruction. While it's mentioned briefly in the text, it's not entirely clear how this equation works or what its significance is.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a thorough evaluation of PolyODE on various time series datasets and highlights its strengths in capturing complex temporal dynamics. With some minor adjustments to address my concerns, I believe this paper has great potential for publication.\n\nFinal decision: Accept with minor revisions.",
                "qwen2.5": "Thank you for providing this detailed section. Overall, I think it gives a comprehensive overview of how the approach was evaluated across different datasets and tasks. The choice of baselines seems well-considered, allowing for a fair comparison between Neural ODE-based methods and long-term memory RNNs.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Comprehensive Datasets**: You've used both synthetic (Synthetic Univariate and Chaotic Attractors) and real-world data (MIMIC-IIII), which is great for validating the approach in diverse scenarios.\n2. **Clear Objectives**: The evaluation objectives are clearly stated, making it easy to follow how well the method performs on reverse reconstruction and downstream classification tasks.\n3. **Ablation Study**: Including an ablation study on interpolation schemes helps to highlight the importance of the neural network component for learning dynamics.\n\n### Suggestions:\n1. **Detailed Methodology in Appendix**:\n   - While details are provided, having more granular steps in the main text could be helpful for readers who might not have easy access to the Appendices.\n2. **Visualization Enhancements**:\n   - Figures 3 and 4 provide valuable insights but might benefit from additional annotations or labels to make them more understandable.\n\n### Concerns:\n1. **Lack of Specific Information on Baseline Models**:\n   - It would be helpful if you could include some brief descriptions of the Neural ODE baselines (e.g., GRU-ODE-Bayes, ODE-RNN) and long-term memory RNN baselines (e.g., HiPPO-RNN) in the main text. This can help readers understand the context better without needing to refer back.\n2. **Interpolation Schemes**:\n   - While Hermite spline interpolation shows promise for classification tasks, it might not be ideal for reverse reconstruction due to higher errors. It would be beneficial to explore other interpolation methods or hybrid approaches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nYour approach is well-validated across multiple datasets and tasks, with clear evidence of superior performance compared to baselines. The inclusion of an ablation study strengthens the argument for the importance of your method's components.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nIf any changes are made based on my suggestions, I think this paper will be even stronger.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help Reviewer 1 as I go through their detailed critique of this paper. Let me start by understanding what they found good and what needs improvement.\n\nFirst, the strengths: The paper is well-structured with clear objectives and thorough experiments across various datasets. They cover both synthetic data, chaotic systems like Lorenz63 and Lorenz96, and a real-world MIMIC dataset. This shows their approach's versatility, which is great because it tests how robust their method is in different contexts.\n\nThe evaluation metrics are solid too\u2014reverse reconstruction performance and downstream classification tasks. They use AUC-ROC for classification, which makes sense since it measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes based on embeddings. For time series reconstruction, MSE provides a straightforward measure of accuracy.\n\nI also notice they've done multiple comparisons across different baselines like Neural ODEs (including HiPPO-RNN variants) and RNNs. This thorough comparison helps establish their method's effectiveness against existing approaches.\n\nNow, the areas needing improvement: The paper could benefit from more interpretability in Figure 3. Maybe adding confidence intervals or shaded areas around the reconstruction lines would make it clearer for readers to understand the uncertainty involved.\n\nAdditionally, while they touch on uncertainty quantification, this aspect isn't fully explored. They mention using uncertainties from different time steps but don't discuss how these can be integrated into applications like healthcare where understanding variability is crucial. This could enhance their contribution by showing not just point estimates but also how reliable those embeddings are.\n\nI should recommend enhancing the explanation of the uncertainty visualization in Figure 4 and possibly adding more experiments or case studies that leverage this uncertainty aspect, especially in critical domains like MIMIC where patient outcomes depend on accurate time series analysis.\n\nOverall, the paper is strong, but by addressing these points, it could make an even bigger impact by providing not only effective embeddings but also reliable measures of their quality and applicability.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of PolyODE's performance across various datasets and tasks. The methodology and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing global time series properties for both reconstruction and classification tasks.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Well-structured Evaluation:** The paper covers multiple datasets (synthetic, chaotic systems, and real-world MIMIC data), showcasing the versatility and robustness of PolyODE.\n- **Diverse Metrics:** Uses a combination of reverse reconstruction performance (MSE) and downstream classification metrics (AUC-ROC), providing a balanced assessment of the method's effectiveness.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n- **Interpretability in Figure 3:** Adding confidence intervals or shaded areas around the reconstructed time series lines could enhance the clarity and understanding of the results.\n- **Uncertainty Quantification:** While the paper touches on uncertainty, it lacks deeper exploration. Incorporating uncertainty quantification into the analysis, particularly in healthcare applications like MIMIC, would add significant value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe paper is a strong contribution to the field, but addressing interpretability and uncertainty could further enhance its impact."

The proposed PolyODE architecture does indeed seem like a promising step forward, given its ability to handle irregular sampling\u2014a common issue in real-world datasets.\n\nOne aspect that caught my attention is the computational cost associated with numerical integration. While it's understandable that this might be an inherent trade-off for such flexibility, I think it would be beneficial if you could provide more insights into how this cost compares against other methods and discuss any potential optimizations or strategies to mitigate this overhead. Perhaps there are ways to fine-tune the architecture or use heuristics to reduce the computational burden without compromising too much on performance.\n\nRegarding the requirement for a large hidden space dimension, I see your point about exploiting the correlation between dimensions as a future direction. However, could you maybe elaborate more on why this is necessary? Is there any specific reason that cannot be addressed with a smaller hidden space dimension, or are these correlations essential for capturing complex dynamics?\n\nLastly, it\u2019s great to see a reproducibility statement and the commitment to make the code public.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to understand this paper about PolyODE. The authors mention that time series representations need to be easy to manipulate, represent global dynamics, useful for downstream tasks, and robust to irregular sampling. They've proposed an architecture called PolyODE which is a Neural ODE designed with these requirements in mind.\n\nFirst off, I know that Neural ODEs are a type of deep learning model that can handle irregularly sampled time series data because they model the continuous dynamics of the system using differential equations. That makes sense for handling irregular sampling since traditional RNNs or LSTMs require evenly spaced time steps. So, PolyODE's ability to handle such data is interesting.\n\nThe authors also mention that while Neural ODEs are good at handling irregular times, there's a computational cost associated with numerical integration. I'm not entirely sure what they mean by this\u2014maybe it refers to the resources or time needed for solving the differential equations during training and inference? That could be a trade-off because complex models often require more computation.\n\nAnother point is about the hidden space dimension being large. They note that increasing the dimension helps, but it's still an issue. I wonder if there are methods to reduce the computational burden without sacrificing performance. Maybe using adaptive step sizes in numerical integration or some form of dimensionality reduction techniques could be explored.\n\nThe reproducibility statement says they have details in Appendix G and will make their code public. That\u2019s good because transparency is important for verifying results and further research. I\u2019d like to see the exact methods used, especially how they handle irregular sampling and if there are any hyperparameter tuning issues mentioned.\n\nI'm also curious about the experimental results. The authors didn't provide them in the text\u2014maybe it's in the supplementary material? Without seeing the results, it's hard to evaluate the effectiveness of PolyODE compared to existing methods. If they show comparable or better performance on specific benchmarks, that would strengthen their claim.\n\nAnother consideration is scalability. How does PolyODE perform with very long time series or high-dimensional data? ODEs can sometimes struggle with these cases unless using certain specialized architectures like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or others designed for high dimensions. It's unclear if they've addressed this.\n\nThere's also the aspect of interpretability. While ODEs can model complex dynamics, they might not offer as much interpretability compared to simpler models like linear regression. This could be a drawback depending on the application\u2014whether interpretability is needed or just predictive performance.\n\nIn terms of future work, the authors suggest exploring methods that exploit dimension correlations in time series data. Maybe using attention mechanisms or other techniques to leverage temporal dependencies more effectively? Additionally, combining PolyODE with other architectures (like transformers) might be an interesting direction to explore for better performance.\n\nI'm also thinking about the initial training phase. Neural ODEs can sometimes take longer to train compared to traditional RNNs due to the need to solve differential equations at each step. This could affect their practicality in real-world applications where computational resources are limited.\n\nOverall, while I see some potential benefits of PolyODE, there are also areas that could be explored further. Without more detailed experimental results and a clearer explanation of how they address computational efficiency issues, it's hard to fully endorse the approach. It would help if they provided comparisons with existing methods on standard benchmarks to demonstrate their solution's superiority.\n\nI should probably look up some papers on PolyODE or any related work that has been done since the paper was submitted. Understanding where it fits in the literature could provide more context and help assess its contributions better.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe authors have presented an interesting approach with PolyODE, leveraging Neural ODEs to handle irregular time series data. While there are areas for further exploration, such as computational efficiency and scalability, the paper makes a reasonable contribution to the field. The reproducibility details and availability of code are commendable. Although more experimental results would enhance the evaluation, the proposed method shows promise with potential for future improvements. Therefore, I accept the paper."

However, I can provide some general insights on the challenges and limitations that many models, including those for learning global representations of high-dimensional time series, may face:\n\n1. **High-Dimensional Curse**: High-dimensional time series data can be challenging to process due to the curse of dimensionality, which leads to increased noise, reduced signal-to-noise ratio, and difficulty in capturing patterns.\n\n2. **Non-Stationarity and Non-Linearity**: Time series data often exhibit non-stationarity (changing over time) and non-linearity, making it difficult for models to learn meaningful representations that capture these complex patterns.\n\n3. **Overfitting**: Models may overfit the training data, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data.\n\n4. **Vanishing or Exploding Gradients**: In deep learning models, vanishing or exploding gradients can occur during backpropagation, making it difficult for the model to converge and learn meaningful representations.\n\n5. **Computational Complexity**: Some models may require significant computational resources to train and evaluate, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\n6. **Interpretability and Explainability**: Models may struggle to provide interpretable and explainable results, making it challenging to understand how they are generating their predictions or embeddings.\n\n7. **Adaptation to New Data**: Models may not adapt well to new data that is significantly different from the training data, requiring retraining or updating of the model.\n\n8. **Balancing Local and Global Representations**: Some models may struggle to balance local (intra-sequence) and global (inter-sequence) representations, which can be challenging in high-dimensional time series data.\n\nThese are general challenges that many models face when learning global representations of high-dimensional time series. The specific limitations of the PolyODE model would depend on its architecture and design.",
                "4.1POLYODE": "Based on the provided system message, I can identify some potential limitations or challenges of the proposed PolyODE model:\n\n1. **Dimensionality curse**: The model's need to track N coefficients for each dimension of the time series might lead to the \"dimensionality curse\", where the number of parameters grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the data, making it difficult to learn accurate representations.\n2. **Correlation between adjacent time series dimensions**: If many adjacent time series are correlated, this can lead to a high-dimensional hidden space for the coefficients, which may be challenging to process and learn effective representations from.\n3. **Limited expressivity of orthogonal polynomials**: While orthogonal polynomials provide a powerful basis for representing functions, they might not be sufficient for modeling complex or highly non-linear relationships between variables in high-dimensional time series data.\n\nThese limitations highlight areas where future work could focus on improving the model's capacity to learn global representations of high-dimensional time series.",
                "4.2TRAININ": "Based on my analysis of the provided system message, I can identify some potential limitations or challenges of the proposed PolyODE model:\n\n1. **Stiffness and instability**: The use of implicit solvers (e.g., Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton) to integrate stiff systems may lead to numerical instability issues, which could affect the accuracy of the learned representations.\n2. **Polynomial approximation limitations**: The model's ability to learn global representations depends on the degree of polynomial approximation (N). Higher values of N might require more computational resources and data, but may also introduce overfitting or underfitting risks.\n3. **Lipschitz constant dependence**: The bound on the mean square error between forward and reverse predictions includes a term dependent on the Lipschitz constant of the temporal process. This suggests that high-frequency components in the time series might be more challenging to reconstruct accurately, potentially limiting the model's ability to learn global representations.\n4. **Weighting function limitations**: The use of a shifted rectangular weighting function with a fixed width might not capture all types of time series data effectively. Alternative weighting functions or adjustable widths might be needed for better performance.\n5. **Scalability and interpretability**: As the dimensionality of the time series increases, the model's ability to learn global representations may become increasingly difficult. Additionally, the interpretability of the learned representations might suffer due to the high-dimensional nature of the data.\n\nThese challenges highlight areas where further research or modifications to the PolyODE model could be necessary to improve its performance and capabilities in learning global representations of high-dimensional time series.",

                "1INTRODUCT": "According to the text, the use of orthogonal polynomials as a basis for the projection of observed temporal processes onto the dynamics function in PolyODE has two main effects:\n\n1. **Enforces encoding of long-range past information**: By projecting the observed temporal process onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials, the model ensures that the dynamics of the hidden process follow this basis, which captures long-range patterns in the data. This design feature makes PolyODE anamnesic, meaning it is capable of retaining information about both recent and distant past states.\n2. **Affects the overall behavior of the model**: The use of orthogonal polynomials as a basis likely influences the dynamics function to be more regular and structured, which can lead to improved stability and convergence properties in the ODE solver. Additionally, this basis may facilitate the learning of a global representation of high-dimensional time series data, as it allows for the encoding of long-range patterns.\n\nIn summary, using orthogonal polynomials as a basis for projection enables PolyODE to capture long-range patterns in the data, which is achieved through the dynamics function and contributes to its anamnesic behavior.",

This changes the way the dynamics function interacts with the rest of the model.\n\nHere are some ways in which the use of orthogonal polynomials can affect the dynamics function and overall behavior:\n\n1. **Memory efficiency**: Orthogonal polynomials can provide a more efficient representation of the temporal process, allowing the model to retain long-term memory without requiring a large capacity of recurrent neural networks.\n2. **Reduced dimensionality**: The projection onto orthogonal polynomials reduces the dimensionality of the data, which can lead to faster training times and improved stability.\n3. **Improved interpolation**: Orthogonal polynomials can be used for linear interpolation between observations, allowing the model to make more accurate predictions at sparse sampling rates.\n4. **Enhanced interpretability**: The use of orthogonal polynomials provides a more interpretable representation of the temporal process, as it allows for the identification of key features and patterns in the data.\n\nHowever, this approach also introduces some limitations:\n\n1. **Loss of information**: The projection onto orthogonal polynomials may lose some information about the underlying temporal process, particularly if the choice of polynomial basis is not optimal.\n2. **Overfitting**: PolyODEs may be more prone to overfitting due to the reduced dimensionality and increased regularization provided by the orthogonal polynomial projections.\n\nOverall, the use of orthogonal polynomials in PolyODEs can lead to a more efficient and interpretable representation of temporal processes, but may require careful tuning of hyperparameters and model architecture to achieve optimal performance.",

This is achieved by integrating the dynamics equations over a finite interval [t-t0,t], which produces a set of coefficients that depend on the input process x(t) and its derivatives up to some order.\n2. **Time-varying basis**: The orthogonal polynomials are time-varying, meaning their coefficients change over time.

In traditional Neural ODEs, the hidden process evolves over time according to a learned dynamics function that maps the current state to the next state.\n\nIn contrast, PolyODE incorporates the dynamics of the basis functions (i.e., the orthogonal polynomials) into the state space. The idea is that these basis functions can capture long-range dependencies and patterns in the data, which are often difficult for traditional Neural ODEs to learn.\n\nBy augmenting the state space with the dynamics of the coefficients of orthogonal polynomials, PolyODE effectively adds an additional layer of information that captures the temporal structure of the data. This is achieved by adding a new component to the hidden process, which represents the evolution of the basis function coefficients over time.\n\nThe key insight behind this augmentation is that the orthogonal polynomials can be used to encode long-range dependencies in the data. Specifically, the dynamics of the basis function coefficients capture the temporal relationships between distant points in the data.\n\nBy incorporating these dynamics into the state space, PolyODE can learn a more general representation of the time series data that captures both local and long-range patterns. This, in turn, enables the model to better reconstruct past time series values and improve its forecasting capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the augmentation of the state space with the dynamics of coefficients of orthogonal polynomials improves the expressivity of PolyODE by allowing it to capture more complex temporal dependencies in the data, which are often difficult for traditional Neural ODEs to learn.",

This is because the additional terms in the basis functions provide more flexibility to capture complex patterns in the data.\n* However, increasing N also increases the risk of overfitting.

                "1INTRODUCT": "Based on my understanding of the system message, I can interpret the observation as follows:\n\nThe result suggests that PolyODE is able to recover more accurate and reliable uncertainty estimates by incorporating long-range memory into its dynamics function. The fact that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the recovered uncertainties and errors is significantly higher (0.56) compared to using the uncertainties obtained from the last time step (0.11) indicates a stronger relationship between the predicted errors and the true uncertainties.\n\nIn other words, PolyODE's ability to capture long-range patterns in the data leads to uncertainty estimates that are more closely tied to the underlying dynamics of the system, resulting in more accurate predictions. This is in contrast to models that rely solely on local information (e.g., using the last time step's uncertainty), which may not capture the full context of the system and result in less reliable uncertainty estimates.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the goal of PolyODE, which is to learn a global representation of high-dimensional time series while retaining long-term memory. By incorporating this long-range information into its dynamics function, PolyODE can provide more accurate and reliable uncertainty estimates that better reflect the underlying patterns in the data.",

This indicates that PolyODEs are able to capture more of the underlying dynamics and variability in the data, leading to more reliable uncertainty estimates.\n\nThis is an important observation because it suggests that PolyODEs can provide more accurate forecasting and reconstruction capabilities by incorporating information from the entire sequence, rather than relying on a simplified or truncated approach. This could be particularly useful for applications where high accuracy and reliability are critical, such as in time series forecasting, signal processing, or control systems.\n\nOverall, this observation supports the idea that PolyODEs can provide more robust and accurate uncertainty estimates compared to simpler approaches, which is an important aspect of many machine learning and modeling tasks.",

This is a counterintuitive result, as one might expect that using more recent information would lead to more accurate and less correlated uncertainty estimates.\n\nHowever, this observation can be interpreted in several ways:\n\n1. **PolyODE's ability to capture temporal dependencies**: PolyODE models temporal dependencies by learning an orthogonal projection of the state over time. This means that it captures the dynamics of the system at each time step using a basis of orthogonal polynomials. By doing so, it may be capturing some of the underlying patterns and structures in the data that are not captured by simply using the last time step's uncertainty estimates.\n2. **The importance of incorporating recent information**: The fact that using uncertainties from the current time step results in more correlated uncertainties with errors suggests that PolyODE is placing a higher weight on incorporating recent information into its uncertainty estimates. This may be because the system's dynamics change over time, and PolyODE is better able to capture these changes by using more recent information.\n3. **The role of orthogonal projections**: The use of orthogonal projections in PolyODE may also contribute to this result. Orthogonal projections can help to reduce the impact of noise and other sources of uncertainty on the uncertainty estimates. By using a basis of orthogonal polynomials, PolyODE may be able to extract more relevant information from the data and produce more accurate uncertainty estimates.\n\nIn summary, the observation suggests that PolyODE's ability to capture temporal dependencies and incorporate recent information into its uncertainty estimates is contributing to the more correlated uncertainties with errors when using current time step uncertainty estimates.",

This implies that PolyODE's method is better able to capture the propagation of uncertainty throughout the entire system, as opposed to just focusing on a single point in time.\n\nThis interpretation makes sense, given that PolyODE is a continuous-time model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that aims to optimize a cost function over a set of future time steps. By using a more comprehensive and dynamic approach to uncertainty estimation, PolyODE may be able to provide more accurate and reliable estimates of system uncertainty that are not limited to a single point in time.\n\nIn contrast, relying solely on the uncertainty at the last time step might lead to an overly simplistic view of the system's behavior, where the uncertainty is \"frozen\" at a particular point in time rather than being subject to change as the system evolves. By incorporating more information about the system's dynamics and uncertainties over multiple time steps, PolyODE may be able to provide a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the system's behavior.",

By using the uncertainties recovered by PolyODE, which are more closely tied to the error structure in the data, the model may be able to better capture the dynamics of the system and reduce its reliance on this short-term perspective.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific model implementation, data characteristics, or other contextual details, this interpretation remains speculative.",
