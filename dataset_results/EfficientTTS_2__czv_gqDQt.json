            "Test": "This text appears to be a research paper on the development of a new text-to-speech (TTS) system called EfficientTTS 2 (EFTS2). The paper aims to overcome the limitations of current one-stage TTS models by proposing a novel end-to-end architecture that achieves competitive performance with two-stage systems while being more efficient.\n\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n\n1. **Hybrid attention mechanism and variational alignment predictor**: A new alignment framework is proposed, which enables the model to learn expressive latent time-aligned representations and controllable diversity in speech rhythms.\n2. **Hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator**: A 2-layer hierarchical VAE-based waveform generator is introduced, which produces high-quality outputs and learns hierarchical and explainable latent variables that control different aspects of the generated speech.\n3. **End-to-end adversarial TTS model**: An end-to-end adversarial TTS model called EFTS2 is developed, which is fully differentiable and can be trained end-to-end, matching the baseline VITS in naturalness and offering faster inference speed and a smaller model footprint.\n\nThe paper also extends EFTS2 to the voice conversion (VC) task, proposing an end-to-end VC model called EFTS2-VC, which achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while obtaining significantly faster inference speed and more expressive speaker-independent latent representations.\n\nOverall, the paper proposes a novel TTS system that addresses some of the limitations of current one-stage models, including alignment efficiency, controllable diversity, and hierarchical representation learning.",

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have had the opportunity to review your paper titled \"EfficientTTS 2: An End-to-End Text-to-Waveform TTS System.\" As a Distinguished Leader with Expert expertise, I appreciate the efforts you have made in addressing some of the challenges faced by current one-stage text-to-speech (TTS) models. Your proposed model, EfficientTTS 2 (EFTS2), appears to be a significant improvement over the existing approaches, and I will elaborate on my thoughts below.\n\nFirstly, I commend you for improving upon the alignment framework of EFTS by proposing a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor. This approach seems promising as it empowers the model to learn expressive latent time-aligned representations and have controllable diversity in speech rhythms, which are important aspects for high-quality TTS systems.\n\nSecondly, I find the introduction of a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator to be an interesting contribution. The ability to produce high-quality outputs and learn hierarchical and explainable latent variables that control different aspects of the generated speech is indeed valuable for further research and practical applications.\n\nHowever, I have a few concerns regarding your work:\n\n1. While EFTS2 matches the baseline VITS in naturalness, it offers faster inference speed and a smaller model footprint. However, the performance of the text-to-waveform model is close to but no better than two-stage models. I believe that this might be a point of discussion for future improvements.\n\n2. In Section 2.3, you mention extending EFTS2 to the voice conversion (VC) task and proposing EFTS2-VC, an end-to-end VC model. The conversion performance of EFTS2-VC is comparable to a state-of-the-art model (YourTTS, Casanova et al. (2022)) while obtaining significantly faster inference speed and much more expressive speaker-independent latent representations. It would be beneficial to include some quantitative results for comparison purposes.\n\n3. In your conclusion, you state that EfficientTTS 2 can serve as a strong baseline for future research in the field of text-to-speech synthesis. While I agree with this statement, it might be useful to discuss any potential limitations or challenges that could arise when building upon EFTS2 and how researchers might address them.\n\nAfter considering all the points mentioned above, I find your work to be well-written, innovative, and valuable for the field of text-to-speech synthesis. Therefore, I recommend you to make the suggested revisions and submit your revised paper for publication.\n\nAccept.\n\nBest regards,\nReviewer 95",
                "llama3.2": "I'd like to start by saying that I appreciate the effort put into addressing some of the concerns raised by previous reviewers. However, after carefully reviewing the paper, I still have several reservations regarding its overall quality and contributions.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to address the comment made by Reviewer 92, who suggested that the authors should provide more details on their alignment framework. While the proposed hybrid attention mechanism and variational alignment predictor are novel ideas, I believe they would benefit from more thorough explanations and supporting evidence.\n\nRegarding the introduction of a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator, I agree with Reviewer 91 that it's an interesting approach, but I'm concerned about the lack of detail on how this component contributes to the overall performance of EFTS2. More analysis on the trade-offs between model size and quality, as well as the impact on inference speed, would strengthen the paper.\n\nMoreover, I'd like to see more discussion on the limitations of the proposed end-to-end adversarial TTS model, EFTS2. While the authors claim it offers faster inference speed and a smaller model footprint, I'm not convinced by these assertions without explicit experiments or comparisons with state-of-the-art models.\n\nI also appreciate the extension of EFTS2 to voice conversion tasks, but I believe more robust evaluation metrics are needed to demonstrate its superiority over existing models like YourTTS.\n\nIn light of these concerns, I would suggest that the authors:\n\n1. Provide more detailed explanations and supporting evidence for their proposed alignment framework.\n2. Conduct a thorough analysis on the trade-offs between model size and quality in the 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator.\n3. Include explicit experiments or comparisons with state-of-the-art models to validate the benefits of EFTS2.\n\nBy addressing these concerns, I believe the paper can strengthen its contributions and provide a more compelling argument for its innovative approach to text-to-waveform TTS systems.\n\nFinal decision: Accept, pending revisions.",
                "qwen2.5": "Sure, let's dive into this section and scrutinize it critically.\n\n### Critique:\n\n#### 1. Introduction to TTS Models\n\nThe overview provided is concise but could be more detailed for a broader audience. For instance, the paragraph jumps from a general introduction of autoregressive (AR) models to non-autoregressive (NAR) models without explaining why these two categories are relevant and distinct in the TTS context. A brief explanation on their key differences might help.\n\n#### 2. Current Challenges with Two-Stage Models\n\nThe section does well by highlighting the limitations of traditional two-stage TTS systems, such as the inability to optimize jointly and the complexity introduced by separate training pipelines. However, it could benefit from a more nuanced discussion on how these issues impact real-world applications. For example, how do these challenges manifest in terms of deployment or performance under different hardware constraints?\n\n#### 3. One-Stage Text-to-Waveform Models\n\nThe review correctly identifies VITS as a promising one-stage model but also points out its limitations, such as the precluded MAS method and the non-differentiable repetition operation. These criticisms are valid and well-articulated. However, it might be beneficial to provide some context on how these issues have been historically addressed in other domains or models. For instance, discussing similar challenges in image generation (like GANs) and how they were tackled could offer additional insights.\n\n#### 4. NaturalSpeech\n\nThe review of NaturalSpeech is accurate but somewhat brief. Discussing the trade-offs between the benefits and increased computational costs would be helpful. Additionally, it might be interesting to mention any specific benchmarks or comparisons with VITS to quantify these trade-offs more concretely.\n\n#### 5. EfficientTTS (EFTS)\n\nThe introduction of EFTS is clear but could benefit from a bit more detail on the motivations behind its design choices. For example, why was a NAR architecture chosen over an AR one? Also, it would be useful to discuss how the performance metrics of EFTS compare to VITS and other models in the literature.\n\n#### 6. EfficientTTS 2 (EFTS2)\n\nThis section seems well-articulated but could use some clarification on why hybrid attention mechanisms and variational alignment predictors are necessary improvements over existing methods. Providing a concrete example or analogy would help readers understand the significance of these contributions more intuitively.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nGiven the detailed critique, while I appreciate the thorough analysis provided, I believe this paper still needs to address several key points for clarity and completeness. Specifically, additional context and justification are needed in some sections, especially regarding the motivations behind certain design choices and trade-offs between different approaches.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nTo improve, authors should expand on the motivations and provide more comparative analysis where necessary. Once these aspects are addressed, I would be happy to reconsider.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to review this paper about an end-to-end text-to-waveform TTS system called EfficientTTS 2. Let me start by reading through the abstract and introduction to understand what it's about.\n\nThe paper discusses the Text-to-Speech task, which is pretty fundamental in NLP and audio processing. They mention that recent advancements have been driven by autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models. I know AR models process data sequentially, one step at a time, while NAR can compute outputs without waiting for previous steps\u2014this might be more efficient but harder to train.\n\nThe paper then talks about the conventional two-stage TTS systems: acoustic modeling followed by a vocoder. They point out that these have issues with optimization and training pipelines being complicated because they separate different parts. So, maybe the one-stage models are better since they handle everything together, simplifying training.\n\nThey mention VITS as an example of a one-stage model, but it has some drawbacks like the MAS method's limitations in back-propagation, using non-differentiable operations for durations, and bijective transformations which might make the model less efficient. Then there's NaturalSpeech, which improves on VITS with differentiable aligners and bidirectional modules, but adds more computational cost during pretraining.\n\nEFTS is another one-stage approach using NAR architecture. It mentions that their text-to-waveform model isn't as good as two-stage models yet. So the authors propose EFTS2 to overcome these issues.\n\nLooking at the contributions: hybrid attention, hierarchical-VAE-based generator, and an end-to-end adversarial model. These sound technical but I'm not sure how they solve the problems mentioned earlier.\n\nPotential strengths of this paper could be introducing a new architecture that addresses known inefficiencies in one-stage TTS models. It's part of ongoing research where each iteration tries to improve upon previous work.\n\nBut wait, are there any clear issues? The paper does a literature review and shows how EFTS2 improves on existing models by addressing their limitations. However, it's somewhat dense with technical details that might be hard for readers without deep expertise to follow. Also, maybe they compare against other recent models or datasets?\n\nI'm concerned about the experimental setup\u2014were there enough experiments done? The performance compared to what exactly? If EFTS2 is only marginally better than VITS but with a much larger model size, that might not be a good trade-off unless it's significantly faster.\n\nAnother point: voice conversion (VC) tasks. They mention extending EFTS2 for VC and getting comparable results but faster. This could be a significant contribution if the speed improvement is substantial.\n\nOverall, the paper seems to present a well-thought-out approach with clear contributions. However, without more detailed experimental validation or comparison against state-of-the-art models in terms of both performance and efficiency, I might be hesitant. Also, the technical details make it challenging for readers new to the field.\n\nI think the key strengths are their novel architecture combining attention mechanisms and VAEs, along with end-to-end training. But without seeing specific metrics or comparisons, it's hard to fully validate their claims. Perhaps they address these in supplementary materials, but since I'm just reading the review, I can't confirm that.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the paper should be accepted if it has clear contributions and a reasonable methodology, even if some details are lacking.\n</think>\n\nThe paper \"EfficientTTS2: End-to-End Text-to-Waveform TTS with Differentiable Alignment\" presents an innovative approach to the text-to-speech task by addressing the limitations of existing one-stage models. The authors propose EFTS2, which combines a hybrid attention mechanism, a hierarchical VAE-based generator, and end-to-end training, aiming to improve efficiency while maintaining naturalness.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novel Architecture:** The integration of hybrid attention and hierarchical-VAE-based generators offers a structured approach that could enhance model efficiency.\n2. **End-to-End Training:** This eliminates the complexity of separate training pipelines typical in two-stage models, simplifying the process.\n3. **Voice Conversion Extension:** The application to VC with improved performance and speed is a notable contribution.\n\n**Concerns:**\n1. **Technical Complexity:** The paper's depth may be challenging for readers without extensive background, potentially hindering accessibility.\n2. **Experimental Validation:** While clear contributions are made, sufficient experimental validation against state-of-the-art models in terms of both performance and efficiency isn't explicitly detailed.\n\nConsidering these points, the paper demonstrates promising advancements but could benefit from further elaboration on experimental details to strengthen its claims. Overall, it offers a well-conceived approach with potential to advance the field, albeit with room for improvement in clarity and validation."

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have reviewed your paper entitled \"Building an Ideal TTS Model: Overcoming Major Challenges in Design\". As a Distinguished Leader reviewer with Expert expertise, I appreciate the effort you've put into addressing the significant challenges in designing Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, particularly the issues of differentiable aligners and generative modeling frameworks.\n\nFirstly, regarding your approach to address challenge (i), I agree with your critique on the complexity and inefficiency introduced by external or non-differentiable internal aligners, as previously noted in several works such as Ren et al., 2019; 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020; 2021; Popov et al., 2021. Your decision to integrate and extend the Efficient Front-to-Back TTS (EFTS) framework to overcome these issues seems reasonable, as it is currently one of the few NAR frameworks that enables both differentiable alignment modeling and high-quality speech generation. However, it would be beneficial if you could provide more evidence or examples showcasing the efficiency gains and improved performance compared to other methods.\n\nRegarding challenge (ii), your choice of using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structure with a hierarchical-VAE-based generator seems justified, given that Auto-Regressive models, Normalizing Flows, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and Variational Auto-Encoders each have their unique limitations in terms of computational efficiency, model size, or quality of the generated samples. You could strengthen your argument by presenting a comparison of your proposed method with these alternatives, highlighting its advantages in terms of training efficiency, sample quality, and any other relevant factors.\n\nIn Section 2.1, you discuss the background knowledge of the differentiable aligner of EFTS, but it would be helpful to include more details on the specific implementation choices made for this component, as well as their impact on the overall model performance. This will enable a better understanding of your approach and its effectiveness compared to other methods.\n\nIn Section 2.2, you present the proposed TTS model EFTS2. It would be beneficial to include an analysis comparing EFTS2 with the original EFTS framework in terms of performance, efficiency, and any other relevant factors. This comparison will help readers understand the improvements and innovations introduced in your work.\n\nIn Section 2.3, you propose EFTS2-VC, a voice conversion model built on EFTS2. It would be helpful to provide more details about how the voice conversion functionality is integrated into the EFTS2 framework, as well as any specific challenges encountered and solutions proposed during this process.\n\nIn conclusion, while your paper presents interesting approaches for addressing major challenges in TTS modeling, I believe that a more detailed comparison with existing methods, additional implementation insights, and empirical evidence of your model's performance would significantly strengthen the quality of your work.\n\n**Final Decision:** Accept with revisions. I encourage you to address the points raised above for a stronger contribution to the TTS literature.",
                "llama3.2": "The section on challenges in designing the TTS model has been thoroughly discussed. I must say that I find some of these points to be quite critical, particularly regarding the need for an internal differentiable aligner.\n\nFirstly, I agree with previous reviewer's comment that soft attention is mostly used in building an internal differentiable aligner, but computing it requires autoregressive decoding, which is inefficient for speech generation. This is a crucial point, and your proposed solution to use Gaussian upsampling and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) seems like a good alternative.\n\nHowever, I have some reservations about the efficiency of training such a system. While DTW may be effective for alignment learning, it can lead to large amounts of computational resources required for training. I would suggest exploring alternative methods that could potentially improve the efficiency of this process.\n\nRegarding the generative modeling framework, I think your proposal to use GAN structure with a hierarchical-VAE-based generator is quite interesting. It seems like an efficient and effective approach, especially considering the limitations of AR models, NFs, DDPMs, and VAEs.\n\nI do have some concerns about the high-fidelity generation capabilities of EFTS2-VC, which I'll discuss further in the next section.\n\nOverall, I think this is a well-written section that effectively addresses the challenges in designing TTS models.

                "qwen2.5": "### Reviewer 95 Feedback\n\nHey there,\n\nThanks for submitting this paper. I\u2019ve gone through it in detail, and while I appreciate the thoroughness with which you address the challenges of TTS model design, there are a few areas that could use some additional clarity and justification.\n\n#### Differentiable Aligner (Section i)\n\nYour point about differentiable aligners is well-taken, but let's delve deeper. You mention EFTS as being unique in enabling both efficient alignment modeling and high-quality speech generation. While this is true, can you provide more context on how EFTS outperforms other methods like DTW or Gaussian upsampling? It would be helpful to see concrete evidence or benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of EFTS over these alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, soft attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) is indeed a common approach. However, discussing its limitations in more detail could strengthen your argument for why EFTS is a better solution. For instance, you might want to elaborate on how autoregressive decoding impacts training efficiency and the quality of generated speech.\n\n#### Generative Modeling Framework (Section ii)\n\nYour choice of using GAN structure with a hierarchical-VAE-based generator seems like a reasonable approach, but I'm curious about your rationale for selecting this specific combination over other generative frameworks. Could you provide more details on why you believe this hybrid model will be particularly effective? Perhaps some preliminary experiments or theoretical analyses that support this choice would add weight to your argument.\n\nMoreover, while discussing the limitations of AR models and NFs is important, it might be useful to explore how your proposed method overcomes these limitations. For example, how does your GAN-based approach handle the linear growth in generation steps mentioned for AR models? Providing such information could help readers understand the unique advantages of your model.\n\n#### Model Structure\n\nIn Section 2.1 and 2.2, you discuss EFTS but don't provide extensive detail on its inner workings or how it integrates with the rest of the proposed TTS model (EFTS2). It would be beneficial to include more technical details here. For instance, what are the key components of the differentiable aligner in EFTS? How does this aligner interact with the overall architecture of EFTS2?\n\nFinally, in Section 2.3, you introduce EFTS2-VC as a voice conversion model built on EFTS2. While this is an interesting addition, it would be useful to see how the alignment and generative modeling techniques discussed earlier are applied specifically in this context.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on these points, I would suggest revising the paper to address the gaps identified above before submitting it for acceptance. If you can provide more detail and justification as outlined, I believe your work will be stronger and more convincing.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nI look forward to seeing a revised version that addresses these concerns!",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to review this paper about their TTS model called EFTS2. Let me read through their abstract again.\n\nThey mention two main challenges: differentiable aligners and generative modeling frameworks. For the aligner part, they talk about using EFTS, which apparently is a NAR framework that allows both alignment and high-quality speech generation. But I'm not super familiar with EFTS, so I need to think about whether this approach makes sense.\n\nI know that traditional TTS systems use external or internal aligners. External ones like Ren et al. (2019) probably don't integrate well into the model training, while internal ones are differentiable but might be inefficient because they require autoregressive decoding, as in soft attention. They mentioned that EFTS is the only NAR framework they know of that can handle both tasks efficiently. If that's the case, integrating it could be a good step.\n\nLooking at the generative part, they propose using GANs with hierarchical VAEs. That sounds complex but might offer better control and efficiency compared to other models like AR or DDPM. I should consider if combining these would indeed improve speech quality and training efficiency.\n\nI'm not sure about their experiments section yet. If they tested EFTS2 on standard datasets and showed improvements over existing methods, that would strengthen the paper. Without those details, it's hard to fully assess the validity of their claims.\n\nAlso, I wonder if they compared different aspects sufficiently.

However, as a Critical reviewer, I have some concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nFirstly, I agree with previous reviewers that the introduction of alignment vectors is an interesting idea. The concept of using non-parametric differentiable transformations to reconstruct the attention matrix aligns with our current understanding of attention mechanisms. However, I believe that the author could provide more clarity on how this approach addresses the limitations of the original scaled dotproduct attention mechanism.\n\nSpecifically, I would like to see a more detailed explanation of why the alignment vector \u03c0 is used instead of \u03b1 directly in the inference phase. Is it not possible to compute \u03b1 using the predicted e\u0302? How does the author justify the use of the reconstructed attention matrix \u03b1\u2032 instead of the original \u03b1?\n\nFurthermore, I have some concerns about the proposed differentiable re-sampling method for computing e.

                "qwen2.5": "Sure, let's dive into this section. The authors introduce EFTS as their foundational work, but there are a few points that I find could be clearer or more rigorously defined.\n\n### Clarity and Detail\n\n1. **Attention Mechanism in Training vs Inference:**\n   - The description of how `\u03b1` is computed during training using the scaled dot-product attention mechanism (Eq. 1) is clear. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that this computation requires both `yh` and `xh`, which might not always be available.\n   - During inference, when `yh` is unavailable, the authors introduce alignment vectors to reconstruct the attention matrix (`\u03b1\u2032`). This transition from `\u03b1` to `\u03b1\u2032` could be explained more succinctly. Perhaps a brief sentence like: \"During inference, since `yh` cannot be directly computed, EFTS introduces alignment vectors to approximate this calculation.\"\n\n2. **Alignment Vectors (\u03c0 and e):**\n   - The definition of the alignment vector \u03c0 as the sum of input indexes weighted by \u03b1 (Eq. 3) is detailed but could benefit from a more intuitive explanation. For example: \"The vector `\u03c0` represents the expected position that each output timestep attends to over all possible input locations.\"\n\n3. **Monotonic Constraints and Additional Transformations:**\n   - The constraints on \u03c0 being monotonic are mentioned (Eq. 4), but the rationale behind these constraints is not clearly explained. Perhaps adding a sentence like: \"These constraints ensure a more interpretable alignment, as they restrict how each output timestep can attend to input locations.\"\n\n4. **Resampling and Aligned Position Vector e:**\n   - The resampling method from \u03c0 to e (Eqs. 5-6) is described, but it could be improved by providing an intuitive example or analogy to help readers grasp the concept better.\n\n### Critique and Suggestions\n\n1. **Clarity of Resampling:**\n   - The resampling process is mathematically sound, but it might benefit from a more visual or textual explanation. For instance, you could say: \"The Gaussian transformation used in Eq. 5 effectively redistributes the alignment values from `\u03c0` to `e`, creating an input-level representation that facilitates tractable computation during inference.\"\n\n2. **Reusability and Generalizability:**\n   - The use of these alignment vectors is specific to TTS but could be generalized for other sequence-to-sequence tasks. The authors might consider discussing the broader applicability of this approach.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the clarity improvements suggested, I would like to see some additional details and intuitive explanations added where necessary. However, the overall framework seems solid and well-explained.\n\n**Decision: Accept with minor revisions**\n\nThe paper can be accepted after addressing these points for increased clarity and reader understanding.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to understand this paper about EFTS. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they mention that their model builds upon EFTS, which is described in Figure 1. From what I gather, the architecture involves a text encoder and a mel-encoder. The text encoder takes a sequence of text tokens (x) and converts them into a vector (xh), while the mel-encoder does something similar for audio features (yh). \n\nDuring training, they use scaled dot-product attention to align text and Mel-spectrograms. That part makes sense because attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating output.\n\nBut here's where it gets a bit tricky. They say that yh isn't available during inference, which means you can't directly compute the alignment matrix \u03b1 using the original method. To solve this, they introduce alignment vectors \u03c0 and e. These are used with some transformations to reconstruct \u03b1', making computation tractable during inference.\n\nLooking at equation (3), \u03c0j is calculated as a weighted sum of input indices based on \u03b1i,j. This means each output timestep looks back over all possible input positions, which seems logical for aligning sequences of different lengths.\n\nThen there are these monotonic constraints on \u03c0 in equations (4). It's good that they're ensuring the alignment makes sense, like not jumping backward or exceeding the input length. But I'm a bit confused about how these constraints are enforced exactly. Are they using specific layers or functions to maintain this structure?\n\nThey also propose a re-sampling method with \u03b3 and e. Using Gaussians might smooth out the alignment but I wonder if it introduces any issues, like over-smoothing which could lose important timing information.\n\nIn training, they use e to build \u03b1', which is then used in inference by predicting e\u0302 from e. This seems a bit indirect, so maybe there's room for improvement here. The reconstruction process might not capture all necessary details of the original alignment.\n\nI'm also curious about how this model handles variable-length inputs and outputs since TTS often deals with different speaker durations. Do they have any experiments comparing EFTS to other models?\n\nOverall, it seems like a solid approach, but there are some unclear parts that could use more explanation.\n</think>\n\nThe paper describes an architecture for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) based on the EFTS model, which addresses the challenge of aligning text and audio sequences during inference. Here's a concise summary and evaluation:\n\n1. **Architecture Overview**: The model uses two encoders to convert text and Mel-spectrograms into hidden vectors. During training, an attention mechanism aligns these vectors.\n\n2. **Alignment Challenge**: During inference, the original alignment matrix \u03b1 is unavailable because yh isn't known. EFTS introduces alignment vectors \u03c0 and e to reconstruct \u03b1', making computation feasible.\n\n3. **Monotonic Constraints**: The paper enforces monotonicity on \u03c0 using Gaussian transformations in equations (8-10), which helps maintain a logical alignment structure.\n\n4. **Reconstruction Process**: \u03b3, an intermediate step, uses Gaussian smoothing to compute the aligned position vector e. This might help smooth timing but could potentially lose detail.\n\n5. **Training vs Inference**: During training, e is used for \u03b1', while inference uses predicted e\u0302. The reconstruction method's effectiveness isn't fully explored in the explanation provided.\n\n6. **Future Considerations**: The paper doesn't explicitly mention experiments comparing EFTS to other models or addressing variable-length inputs.\n\nIn conclusion, EFTS presents a novel approach to TTS alignment with promising theoretical underpinnings but requires more detailed explanations on how it handles certain aspects and performs in comparison to existing methods."

The authors have divided their generator model into two main blocks: a differentiable aligner and a hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the differentiable aligner takes an input hidden state xh and maps it to an aligned hidden representation xalign. That makes sense because alignment is crucial in tasks like speech synthesis where timing matters. I'm assuming that this part ensures that the model can adjust the temporal information properly, which might help with generating outputs that are more aligned with the target.\n\nThen there's the hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator, which uses xalign to produce the output y. Hierarchical VAEs are known for their ability to model complex data structures by breaking them down into multiple levels of abstraction. So, this seems like a solid approach because it can capture intricate patterns in waveform generation.\n\nBut wait, I'm wondering about the practical implementation. How exactly is xalign used? Is there any explanation on how the alignment affects the waveform generation? Maybe the paper should delve deeper into how these two components interact and whether the alignment step adds significant value over existing methods. Also, are there any potential limitations of this approach that could be discussed?\n\nI'm also thinking about the evaluation part. How did they measure the performance of their model? If they only look at standard metrics like reconstruction error or similarity to real waveforms without considering computational efficiency or resource usage, it might miss some important aspects.\n\nAnother point is interpretability.

The authors propose a new differentiable aligner architecture that improves upon existing models by incorporating a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor.\n\nHere's a summary of the key points:\n\n**Hybrid Attention Mechanism**\n\n* The authors introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that combines two attention matrices: \u03b1(1) derived from the alignment vector e, and \u03b1(2) derived from token boundaries.\n* The A2B transformation maps an attention matrix to boundary pairs (a, b), while the B2A transformation maps boundary pairs to a reconstructed attention matrix \u03b1(2).\n* The proposed approach is differentiable, enables batch computation, and is potentially better than existing methods.\n\n**Variational Alignment Predictor**\n\n* The authors propose a variational alignment predictor (VAP) that predicts the alignment vector e and boundary positions a and b.\n* The VAP encoder receives relative distances e\u2212a and b\u2212a as inputs and outputs a latent posterior distribution q\u03d5(zA|e\u2212a, b\u2212a,xh).\n* The VAP decoder estimates the output distribution by inputting zA, conditioned on xh.\n* The training objective of the VAP is computed as a combination of reconstruction loss and KL divergence between the posterior and prior distributions.\n\n**Inference Phase**\n\n* In the inference phase, the alignment vector e\u0302 and boundary positions a\u0302 and b\u0302 are computed using sampled values from the standard Gaussian distribution.\n* A stop gradient operation is added to the inputs of the VAP encoder to help the model learn a more accurate alignment in the training phase.\n\nOverall, this paper proposes a novel architecture for TTS synthesis that incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor.

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have carefully reviewed your paper titled \"Improving End-to-End Text-to-Speech Synthesis with a Differentiable Aligner\" and I appreciate the innovative approach you've presented to enhance the performance of EFTS in TTS tasks. The hybrid attention mechanism and variational alignment predictor introduced in your work are interesting contributions, and I believe they have the potential to significantly improve the quality of text-to-speech synthesis models.\n\nThe hybrid attention mechanism seems well-justified, as it addresses the issue of multiple output frames being attended by a single input token, which is common in TTS tasks. By considering both the aligned position and boundary positions, the model appears to have better control over the rhythm and duration of speech generation. I agree with the previous reviewer that the approach resembles the multi-head attention mechanism, but it is differentiated by its focus on time alignment and the use of learnable linear transformations.\n\nRegarding the variational alignment predictor, I find the idea compelling as it considers the alignment prediction problem as a generative problem. This allows for more flexibility in expressing the same text input with different rhythms, which is an important aspect of natural-sounding speech synthesis. The training objective and the inference phase seem to be well-defined, and I can see how the VAP could help improve the accuracy of alignment prediction compared to a vanilla deterministic alignment predictor.\n\nOne potential concern I have is the choice of using non-causal WaveNet residual blocks for both the encoder and decoder of the VAP. While this may work well in practice, it is worth considering the computational complexity and memory requirements of such architectures, especially when dealing with longer sequences. Additionally, I would suggest experimenting with other architecture options to ensure that the current choice provides the best possible performance for the task at hand.\n\nIn terms of the overall organization of the paper, it seems well-structured, but I believe a brief introduction to the problem and motivation for using a variational alignment predictor could be helpful in setting the context for readers who are not already familiar with EFTS or NAR TTS models.\n\nOverall, I found your work interesting and insightful, and I recommend it for publication with the suggested revisions. I think the innovative contributions presented have the potential to make a significant impact on the field of text-to-speech synthesis.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**",

I have no conflict of interest, and my feedback tone is critical.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to commend the authors on their effort to improve the differentiable aligner using a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor (VAP). The proposed approach seems to address some of the limitations of previous models in TTS tasks. However, upon closer inspection, I have several concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nOne major issue I have is with the explanation of the A2B transformation. While the authors provide a mathematical formulation for this transformation, it's not entirely clear how it integrates the two attention matrices \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2). The notation used in Eq. (3)\u2212\u2192 \u03c0 \u2208 RT2 seems somewhat ambiguous, and I'd like to see a more detailed explanation of how this transformation works.\n\nFurthermore, the authors claim that their approach is differentiable and enables batch computation, which is an important aspect for large-scale TTS models. However, I'm not convinced by the provided justification in Eq. (6) and Eq. (10). Without more rigorous mathematical proofs or experimental evidence, it's difficult to assess the actual benefits of this approach.\n\nI also have concerns about the training objective of the VAP, particularly the use of the KL divergence term (Eq. 12). While I understand the importance of regularizing the model to ensure a proper alignment, I'm not sure if this particular approach is effective in achieving that goal.\n\nAnother issue I have is with the assumption that one text input can be expressed with different rhythms. While this might be true in some cases, I'm not convinced that this assumption holds for all possible inputs. How would the authors address this limitation?\n\nLastly, I'd like to see more experimental results to support the claims made by the authors. What are the performance metrics used to evaluate the different models? How do they compare to state-of-the-art methods in TTS tasks?\n\nIn conclusion, while the proposed approach shows promise, it needs significant revisions and refinements to address these concerns.

                "qwen2.5": "Sure, let's dive into the details of this section.\n\nFirst off, it's great to see that the authors have introduced a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor as key improvements over EFTS. However, there are several points where I feel the explanation could be more clear and detailed for the reader.\n\n1. **Hybrid Attention Mechanism:**\n   - The introduction of the hybrid attention mechanism is well-motivated, but the transformation steps from `\u03b1` to `A2B`, and then to `B2A` are a bit complex and may require additional visual aids or more detailed explanations for better comprehension.\n   - It would be helpful if the authors provided concrete examples or use cases where this hybrid mechanism outperforms traditional methods. This could help readers understand the practical implications of these transformations.\n\n2. **Boundary Positions:**\n   - The process from `A2B` to `B2A` is well-formulated, but it might benefit from a more intuitive explanation of how the energy function leads to the final attention matrix.\n   - Clarifying the choice of `\u03c3` as learnable and explaining its role in balancing the model's performance could also be useful.\n\n3. **Variational Alignment Predictor:**\n   - The motivation for using a variational alignment predictor (VAP) is clear, but more context on why it is better than deterministic approaches would strengthen this section.\n   - While the equations provided are detailed, they might benefit from being broken down into smaller, more digestible parts. For instance, explaining each component of Equation (12) separately could help in understanding its contribution to the overall objective function.\n\n4. **Inference Phase:**\n   - The inference phase is described accurately, but it would be helpful if there were a few sentences on how the `stop gradient` operation aids in learning accurate alignments during training.\n\nGiven these points, I think with some revisions and clarifications, this section can be significantly improved for clarity and understanding. However, the core concepts are solid, and I believe they will contribute positively to the research paper if addressed adequately.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nI would recommend a **minor revision** before accepting this section. The authors should address the points mentioned above to make the content more accessible and clearer to readers.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper's section about their differentiable aligner. They introduced two improvements: a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the hybrid attention mechanism. From what I gather, they're combining two attention matrices. The first one is from EFTS as before, using Eq.2-6. Then they have this second matrix \u03b1(2) built from token boundaries. They call it B2A transformation and explain how \u03c0 (the alignment vector) gets converted into boundary pairs (a,b). \n\nI'm a bit confused about the A2B transformation. The equations for \u03b2i,j look like some sort of Gaussian-like distribution, but I wonder why they use that specific form. Also, pi is defined as 0 when i=0 and i-0.5 otherwise. That seems linear scaling, maybe to map positions from one range to another.\n\nThen ai is the average of neighboring n's for each i. For bi, if it's not the last token, it's ai+1; else, it's T2\u22121. This makes sense as boundaries defining a range for alignment. So \u03b1(2) uses these (a,b) pairs to create attention weights.\n\nThe B2A part uses an energy function based on distance from the boundaries. If j is within [ai, bi], energy is 0; else, it decreases with distance. This makes sense because tokens should align within their boundary ranges.\n\nThey combine \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) by taking max for each position. I'm not sure if this is correct\u2014shouldn't they be additive? Maybe using sum would better capture the combined attention.\n\nMoving on to VAP, it's a variational approach where e\u2212a and b\u2212a are predicted along with zA from an encoder conditioned on xh. The decoder estimates d(1) and d(2), which predict log(e\u2212a) and log(b\u2212a). The loss combines reconstruction and KL divergence.\n\nIn training, they use \u03bb coefficients for these terms. I wonder what values they used or if the balance is appropriate. Also, during inference, e^ is computed using exponents from d(1) and zA. But why exp? Maybe to ensure positive values since alignment distances should be positive.\n\nThe VAP encoder uses relative distances as input, which makes sense because alignment can vary based on text but rhythm needs prediction. Using non-causal WaveNet blocks for both encoder and decoder seems reasonable for processing sequences without causality issues.\n\nI'm concerned about the hybrid attention mechanism's implementation. Taking max might not capture additive effects well. Maybe they should sum instead to combine the two attention matrices. Also, how does this affect model performance compared to using either method alone?\n\nFor the VAP part, using KL divergence could encourage exploration of latent space but might lead to missing some data due to KL term overpowering reconstruction loss. They have \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 for balancing these terms; perhaps their values need tuning.\n\nI'm also thinking about how this aligner integrates into the overall NAR TTS model. The hierarchical VAE is used later, so ensuring that alignment vectors are accurately predicted early on should help in generating high-quality audio. But if alignment is noisy or incorrect, it might propagate errors downstream.\n\nAnother thought: using a hybrid mechanism with both fixed pi and learned ai, bi could make the aligner more flexible. However, the linear scaling for pi seems arbitrary; maybe other mappings would work better. They didn't mention any ablation studies in their results section, which is crucial to validate these changes' effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, I think they have a solid foundation with hybrid attention and variational alignment prediction. But there are implementation details that could be improved: using sum instead of max for combining \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2), choosing appropriate \u03bb values, ensuring the VAP training loss is balanced, and possibly exploring alternative pi mappings.\n\nI'll need to ask for more experimental results in their paper or see how these components perform compared to existing methods.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces a differentiable aligner with two key improvements: a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor (VAP). Here's a structured summary of the analysis:\n\n1. **Hybrid Attention Mechanism**:\n   - Combines \u03b1(1) from EFTS and \u03b1(2) based on token boundaries.\n   - Uses A2B transformation for \u03c0 to boundary pairs (a,b), with specific scaling for pi, which might need further validation.\n   - B2A transformation employs an energy function to create attention weights within defined boundaries.\n\n   **Improvement Suggestions**:\n     - Consider using summation instead of max for combining \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) to better capture additive effects.\n\n2. **Variational Alignment Predictor (VAP)**:\n   - Predicts relative distances e\u2212a and b\u2212a using an encoder-decoder setup with WaveNet blocks.\n   - Balances reconstruction loss and KL divergence in training, requiring appropriate \u03bb coefficients.\n\n   **Improvement Suggestions**:\n     - Explore alternative pi mappings to enhance flexibility.\n     - Ensure balanced training without overpowering either term.\n\n3. **Integration into NAR TTS Model**:\n   - The aligner feeds into the hierarchical VAE for waveform generation, crucial for high-quality audio synthesis.\n   - Potential need for additional experimental validation and studies to confirm effectiveness.\n\n4. **Implementation Considerations**:\n   - Ensure correct implementation of transformations (e.g., pi scaling) based on domain knowledge.\n   - Consider ablation studies in results to validate changes' impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a promising framework with room for refinement in implementation details and experimental validation. The final decision is based on these considerations, leading to an acceptance of the paper's contributions while highlighting areas needing further exploration."

Posterior network: takes linear spectrograms as input and outputs two latent Gaussian posterior distributions.\n2. Hierarchical prior network: consists of two stochastic layers, the first layer receiving xalign as input and outputting a latent Gaussian prior distribution, and the second layer taking z1 as input and formulating another latent Gaussian prior distribution.\n3. Decoder: produces the waveform from the latent variable z2.\n\n**Training objective**: The overall training objective is to minimize the reconstruction error between the real and predicted waveforms and the KL divergence between the prior and posterior distributions.\n\n**Key differences with previous works**: EFTS2 differs from previous TTS models in two aspects:\n\n1. 2-layer hierarchical VAE structure, which allows for a more efficient training.\n2. KL divergence calculation between two multivariate Gaussian distributions, which is more efficient than estimating it between a latent variable and a multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n\n**Architecture details**: The model uses stacks of non-causal WaveNet residual blocks with estimated means and variations to parameterize the prior estimators and posterior estimator. The decoder is inspired by the generator of HiFi-GAN (Kong et al., 2020) and trained on sliced latent variables for memory efficiency.\n\nOverall, this text provides a technical overview of the EFTS2 model, highlighting its key components, training objective, and differences with previous works in TTS research.",

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to review this paper about their TTS model called EFTS2. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe abstract says they're using a VAE-based generator for waveform production. From what I remember, VAEs are good for learning latent representations but can be tricky with training because of the KL divergence term. They mention an issue where the prior has no acoustic info while the posterior is supposed to be informative based on audio features. That makes sense\u2014without enough info in the prior, it's hard for the model to learn effectively.\n\nThey introduce a hierarchical-VAE structure with two layers. The first layer takes xalign and outputs z1 from a prior, then z2 depends on z1. During training, z1 comes from the posterior q(z1|y), but during inference, it uses the prior p(z1|xalign). So this might help bridge the information gap between the prior and posterior.\n\nLooking at their training objective (Equation 15), they have two KL divergences: one between the prior and posterior for z1 and another for z2. They also added reconstruction loss with lambda3 for mel-spectrogram. This seems like a way to balance different losses, but I wonder if it's too simplistic.\n\nThey mention that previous models use single-layer VAEs and compute KL divergence between a sample and the prior. Here, using two layers allows them to compare two Gaussians directly via KL divergence. That might lead to more stable training because each layer can adjust its own latent space better. But I'm not sure how this affects computational efficiency since slicing audio for memory is already mentioned.\n\nI also notice they use non-causal WaveNet blocks in their parameterizations, which sounds reasonable as it helps with parallel processing. The decoder is inspired by HiFi-GAN's generator, so that should work well too.\n\nBut wait, what about the trade-offs? Using a two-layer VAE might complicate the model and increase training time or memory usage due to slicing. They mention sliced variables for memory efficiency in decoding, which is good. However, if the slices are too small, it might affect the quality of generated audio.\n\nDo they provide ablation studies or comparisons with single-layer models? The paper doesn't mention it here, so that's a point against their method. Also, while using two layers allows comparing two Gaussians, does this approach handle the information gap better than before?\n\nI'm concerned about whether this hierarchical structure actually addresses the core problem of the prior being uninformative. Maybe by having z1 depend on xalign and z2 on z1, it provides a more structured latent space that's easier to sample from in training.\n\nBut I also wonder if this approach might introduce new challenges during inference or generation since z2 now depends on both ylin (through q(z2|ylin)) and z1. How do they ensure the model can handle this dependency smoothly?\n\nOverall, their approach seems innovative by using a hierarchical VAE to better align prior and posterior distributions. It could lead to more stable training and potentially better waveform generation. However, without empirical evidence of performance improvements over existing models, especially since previous work already achieved similar results with single-layer VAEs, the contribution might be incremental.\n\nI think the key strength is the introduction of a hierarchical structure that allows for more nuanced modeling of the latent space. But I'm not sure if this alone is sufficient to justify acceptance without further evidence or comparison.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces EFTS2, a TTS model utilizing a two-layer hierarchical VAE for waveform generation. The key innovation lies in structuring the latent variables into z1 and z2, allowing each layer to learn more granular features while addressing the information gap between prior and posterior distributions.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Hierarchical Structure:** The two-layer VAE enables a structured latent space, potentially improving model learning by decoupling low-level (z1) and high-level (z2) representations. This structure allows for better alignment of priors with posteriors.\n- **Training Objective:** By decomposing the KL divergence into two terms, each layer can be optimized separately, which may lead to more stable training.\n\n**Concerns:**\n- **Model Complexity:** The hierarchical approach increases model complexity and computational demands due to slicing audio into smaller segments. This could affect efficiency and introduce new challenges during inference.\n- **Lack of Evidence:** The paper lacks comparisons with single-layer VAE models like EFTS, which may limit the demonstration of significant improvements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe hierarchical VAE approach offers a novel way to model latent variables, potentially enhancing training stability. However, without empirical evidence of performance gains over existing methods and due to increased computational demands, further study is warranted. The paper's contribution could be deemed incremental in its current form."

As a Distinguished Leader reviewer with Expert expertise, I appreciate the effort that has been put into this research. However, I must express some critical feedback to help improve the quality of your work.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to clarify the overall motivation behind using multiple discriminators in the EFTS2 model, beyond simply following previous works (Kong et al., 2020; You et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021). It would be beneficial for readers to understand the specific advantages and improvements gained by employing multiple discriminators in the proposed model compared to single-discriminator architectures.\n\nSecondly, while the use of the feature matching loss (Lfm) for training stability is common practice, it would be valuable to provide a justification as to why this particular loss function is well-suited for the EFTS2 model and how it contributes to the overall performance of the model.\n\nThirdly, the paper mentions that the phoneme encoder in EFTS2 is parameterized by a stack of feed-forward Transformer blocks, similar to both EFTS and VITS. However, it would be informative to discuss any modifications or improvements made to the phoneme encoder specifically for EFTS2 that differentiate it from these other models.\n\nRegarding the proposed differentiable aligner, more details are needed to understand its functioning effectively. It is essential to explain how this aligner outputs the time-aligned latent representation xalign and how it contributes to the overall performance of the model.\n\nLastly, the training objective equation (16) presents the components of the loss function for the proposed generator G.

(2020). This part seems well-covered.\n   \n2. **Feature Matching Loss**:\n   - The use of feature matching loss \\(L_{fm}\\) for training stability is mentioned, which is good as it ensures that generated samples are close to real samples in terms of feature space.\n\n3. **Training Phase and Components**:\n   - The description of the phoneme encoder using feed-forward Transformer blocks aligns well with established practices.\n   - However, there's a bit more detail needed here.

Do they use positional encodings or other mechanisms to manage sequences effectively?\n\n4. **Differentiable Aligner**:\n   - The introduction of the differentiable aligner as part of the EFTS2 architecture is interesting and adds a layer of complexity. However, it would be helpful if you could elaborate on how this aligner works in detail. Specifically, what kind of alignment does it perform (e.g., time-domain, frequency-domain)? Are there any trade-offs or limitations associated with using such an aligner?\n\n5. **Waveform Generator**:\n   - The hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator is mentioned, but a brief explanation on why this architecture was chosen over others could strengthen the justification for your choice.\n   \n6. **Training Objective**:\n   - The training objective equation \\(L_{total} = L_{wav} + L_{align} + L_{adv}(G) + L_{fm}(G)\\) is clear, but it might be useful to explain each term in more detail or provide a reference for where this formula comes from.\n\nOverall, the architecture description is solid and follows established practices.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper about EFTS2. From what I gather, it's using a GAN architecture with a generator and multiple discriminators. They mention following Kong et al., 2020, which is good because that gives me some confidence they're referencing established work.\n\nThe paper talks about the training phase involving various components: phoneme encoder, spectrogram encoder, differentiable aligner, and a hierarchical-VAE-based generator. The loss function Ltotal includes Lwav for waveform generation, Lalign for alignment, adversarial loss, and feature matching loss. They also mention using multiple discriminators as in previous works.\n\nHmm, but wait\u2014their setup seems familiar. I remember reading that having too many discriminators can slow down training because each adds a computation layer. Also, with so many discriminators, the generator might find it hard to satisfy all of them, which could lead to instability or mode collapse. Maybe they're not doing enough analysis on this? They should compare their multiple discriminators setup against simpler ones in experiments.\n\nThe use of feature matching loss (Lfm) is good for stability, but if Ladv(G) doesn't contribute much compared to Lfm and Lalign, it might be redundant. I'm thinking maybe they could simplify by removing the adversarial part since it's adding more parameters without clear benefit.\n\nThey mention using a hierarchical-VAE for waveform generation, which sounds complex. If the training data is limited or there are computational constraints, this complexity might not be necessary. Perhaps simplifying to a single VAE would help reduce overfitting and make training faster.\n\nAlso, they don't specify why they chose these particular hyperparameters like the number of layers in the Transformer blocks or learning rates. Without sensitivity analysis, it's hard to know if their model is optimal. They should at least try different configurations to see what works best.\n\nI'm concerned about how they evaluated the model. They mention experiments on a dataset but don't tell me much about metrics besides loss functions and sample quality. If I were using this model, I'd want concrete numbers like PSNR or perceptual scores. Including these would strengthen their evaluation.\n\nLastly, the paper doesn't discuss potential limitations. For example, how does EFTS2 handle different speaking styles or accents? Understanding its robustness to various inputs is important for real-world applications.\n\nOverall, while there are strengths in using GANs and multiple discriminators, some areas like hyperparameter tuning, model simplification, evaluation metrics, and robustness analysis need more attention.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting approach with several strengths. The use of a GAN architecture is appropriate, though the inclusion of multiple discriminators could be optimized for computational efficiency. While the feature matching loss (Lfm) contributes to training stability, it's important to ensure that Ladv(G) adds significant value beyond what Lfm and Lalign provide. Simplifying the model by potentially removing the adversarial component might improve performance without compromising stability.\n\nThe hierarchical-VAE could be simplified for computational efficiency, which would also aid in reducing overfitting. Without sensitivity analysis on hyperparameters such as the number of Transformer layers or learning rates, it's crucial to conduct thorough testing to ensure optimality.\n\nThe evaluation criteria are somewhat limited; adding metrics like PSNR and perceptual scores would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. Additionally, discussing potential limitations, such as handling different speaking styles, could enhance the paper's robustness analysis.\n\nOverall, while there are areas for improvement, the foundational work is solid and worth accepting with suggestions for further refinement."

Additionally, including experimental results comparing models with and without speaker embeddings could help strengthen your arguments.\n\nLastly, I found the concept of using EFTS2-VC as a disentanglement network that strips speaker identity while preserving textual information intriguing. However, it would be helpful to provide more concrete evidence supporting this claim, such as visualizing the learned speaker and textual representations or demonstrating the model's ability to transfer the content of one speaker to another effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential merits of EFTS2-VC, there are several aspects that require further clarification and experimental evidence to strengthen your argument. Based on these concerns, I recommend revising the paper and providing a more detailed explanation of the model's design, its impact on performance, and experimental results to support your claims.\n\n**Final Decision:** Accept (with revisions)",

                "qwen2.5": "Hey there,\n\nFirst off, I appreciate the detailed explanation of EFTS2-VC in this section. However, I need to be critical here because some aspects could use refinement for clarity and robustness.\n\n1. **Alignment Predictor Exclusion**: The rationale for excluding the alignment predictor is sound, as it streamlines the model and leverages existing knowledge on text-spectrogram alignment. However, a more detailed discussion of how this exclusion impacts performance or introduces potential issues would be helpful. For instance, if there's any risk of misalignment leading to degraded speech quality, that should be addressed.\n\n2. **Reconstructed Attention Matrix**: The derivation of the attention matrix from \\(\\pi\\) (Eq. 17) is an interesting approach. However, I suggest providing more context on why this simplification works better than using e or token boundaries. Additionally, a thorough validation of the accuracy gains with real-world data would strengthen this claim.\n\n3. **Speaker Embedding Introduction**: Introducing speaker embeddings to the spectrogram encoder and generator stages makes sense but could benefit from a clearer explanation of how these embeddings are utilized differently during training versus inference. Specifically, detailing how the disentanglement network operates independently of the reconstruction network is important for understanding the model's functionality.\n\n4. **Hierarchical-VAE Framework**: While your discussion on the hierarchical-VAE framework and the implications for speaker disentanglement and content preservation are clear, I would recommend adding some experimental evidence to back up these claims. For example, how does this model perform compared to EFTS2 without these modifications? Any quantitative metrics or comparison studies with existing methods would provide a more convincing argument.\n\nIn summary, while the proposed model shows promise, there's room for improvement in terms of detailed explanations and supporting evidence. Addressing the points above should help solidify the paper\u2019s claims and make it more robust.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nI hope this feedback helps improve the paper before submission!",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper about voice conversion using EFTS2-VC. The user provided a section from the paper, which is pretty technical, and they want me to act as Reviewer 95 with a critical tone but no conflicts of interest.\n\nFirst, let me break down what EFTS2-VC does. It's supposed to modify speech so that it sounds like a target speaker while keeping the content intact. That makes sense for things like language change or speaker impersonation.\n\nLooking at their model modifications: they removed the alignment predictor in inference. I remember from previous knowledge that alignment is crucial in voice conversion because it maps text to speech. If you remove this, how does the model handle the alignment during synthesis? It seems important because without it, the model might struggle to produce accurate speech that matches both the content and target speaker.\n\nNext, they're using an attention matrix \u03b1' derived from \u03c0 instead of token boundaries. The equation provided is a bit dense, but it looks like they're modeling similarity between positions in the text and the spectrogram. This could help align text more accurately with the audio. However, I'm not sure how this compares to traditional methods or if there are any trade-offs.\n\nThey mention using multiple reconstructed attentions with learnable \u03c3(k)\u03c0. That seems like a way to capture different attention patterns for each layer or speaker, which might improve flexibility but could also complicate training and computation.\n\nThe part about speaker embeddings is interesting. They're conditioning the model on source and target speakers separately, which probably helps in disentangling speaker information from content. But I wonder if this approach covers all possible scenarios, like when only one piece of information is available during inference.\n\nIn their explanation, they mention using a hierarchical-VAE framework. VAEs can be tricky because of the KL divergence term and posterior approximation issues. They're training priors based on text without speaker info, which might limit how well the model can disentangle speakers. Maybe they should explore other architectures or loss functions that better handle conditional generation.\n\nThe inference process is described as conditioning the networks on different speakers\u2014source for encoding, target for decoding. That makes sense in a way, but I'm concerned about how generalizable this is if there's no overlap between source and target speakers during training. Also, computational efficiency might be an issue since each conversion would require interacting with two separate networks.\n\nThey mention experiments on standard datasets, which is good, but without results like objective metrics or user studies, it's hard to assess performance comprehensively. Maybe they should include some evaluation methods similar to those used in speech synthesis tasks.\n\nIn terms of contributions, this model seems to address several challenges: automatic alignment, content preservation, and multi-speaker conversion. That's a solid foundation, but I'm curious about the practicality. Can it handle real-time conversions or does it require extensive computation?\n\nAlso, I notice they don't compare directly with other voice conversion methods like parallel WaveNet or DiaCon. It would be beneficial to see how their approach stacks up against existing solutions in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.\n\nFinally, the mathematical details are clear, but maybe there's room for more intuition on why certain choices were made, like the specific form of \u03b1' or the use of multiple \u03c3(k)\u03c0 terms. Providing a bit more background could help readers understand the model's rationale better.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a well-thought-out approach with several innovations. However, it has some areas where further clarification and comparison would strengthen its contributions.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe paper introduces an innovative voice conversion model, EFTS2-VC, which addresses key challenges in aligning content and speaker characteristics during speech synthesis. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple novel components such as the use of an attention matrix derived from \u03c0, a hierarchical-VAE framework for disentangling speaker information, and conditioned reconstruction networks. These features contribute to preserving the source content while adapting the target speaker's characteristics effectively.\n\nThe model's modifications, including the exclusion of alignment predictor in inference and the introduction of multiple reconstructed attentions, offer potential improvements in speech quality and conversion fidelity. The use of a hierarchical-VAE framework is particularly noteworthy for its ability to disentangle textual information from speaker identity, enhancing the model's flexibility and performance.\n\nThe paper also includes experiments on standard datasets, providing a foundation for evaluation, though further comparisons with existing methods like parallel WaveNet or DiaCon could offer additional insights into its effectiveness. While mathematical details are clear, more intuitive explanations of key design choices would enhance understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, EFTS2-VC presents a well-thought-out approach with significant contributions to voice conversion technology. The model's potential for practical applications in speech synthesis and speaker impersonation is promising, though further validation and comparison with existing methods could strengthen its appeal."

I would like to see a more detailed analysis of what constitutes \"natural\" speech in this context and how your findings align with existing definitions.\n\nYou also discuss ablation studies, showing the importance of the hierarchical-VAE structure, hybrid attention mechanism, and the deterministic alignment predictor (DAP). I found it interesting that removing these components leads to a significant MOS decrease. However, you state that DAP has a similar MOS score to the variational alignment predictor but lacks diversity. Could you elaborate more on this? Specifically, what do you mean by \"diversity\" in this context and why is it crucial for speech generation?\n\nIn conclusion, while I believe your paper makes valuable contributions to the field of text-to-speech synthesis, I think there is room for improvement. The discussion needs to be more thorough, particularly regarding the comparison between EFTS2 and VITS, the definition of \"natural\" speech, and the importance of diversity in speech generation.\n\n**Final decision:** Accept (with revisions)\n\nI hope these comments help improve your paper and look forward to seeing a revised version soon.

While it's true that both models achieve comparable scores to ground truth audios, I believe that a more nuanced discussion is needed. How do these results contribute to our understanding of speech synthesis? What insights can be gained from comparing these two models?\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to see more detailed explanations of the ablation studies. While it's great that removing either the hierarchical-VAE structure or the hybrid attention mechanism leads to a significant MOS decrease, what exactly does this tell us about the importance of each component? Are there any other potential interactions between these components that could be explored?\n\nI also have some concerns about the use of the 5-scale mean opinion score (MOS) evaluation. While it's a widely used metric in speech synthesis evaluations, I'm not convinced that it's the most informative or robust measure for this task. Have alternative metrics been considered? For example, could the more nuanced evaluation metrics available for natural speech quality assessments provide a better picture of EFTS2 and VITS performance?\n\nLastly, I'd like to see more discussion about the limitations of EFTS2. While it's great that it outperforms 2-stage EFTS-CNN, what are the potential trade-offs in terms of computational complexity or model size? How does EFTS2 compare to other state-of-the-art models in this space?\n\nIn light of these concerns, I believe that the author needs to revisit and strengthen their discussion about the results and limitations of EFTS2.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject.",

The authors compare EFTS2 with VITS and a previous model in their family, EFTS-CNN + HIFI-GAN, using MOS scores on the LJ-Speech dataset. This is a solid approach to assessing the quality of generated audio samples.\n\n### Critique:\n\n1. **Comparison with Baseline Models:**\n   - The authors state that \"EFTS2 significantly outperforms 2-stage EFTS-CNN\" and there is no significant difference between EFTS2 and VITS. These claims are based on the MOS scores shown in Table 1.\n   - However, it\u2019s crucial to validate these claims with more context. Specifically:\n     - **Detailed MOS Scores:** The authors should provide detailed MOS scores for each model to support their claims of outperformance or parity. This would make the results more transparent and easier to replicate.\n     - **Statistical Significance:** While stating that EFTS2 significantly outperforms a 2-stage model is good, it would be even stronger if accompanied by statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) showing the significance level.\n\n2. **Quality of Audio Samples:**\n   - The authors mention that both EFTS2 and VITS achieve comparable scores to ground truth audios, indicating very close quality to natural speech.\n   - **Qualitative Evaluation:** While MOS is a quantitative measure, qualitative evaluations or subjective listening tests could provide additional support for the claims. Including such assessments would give readers a more holistic view of the quality differences.\n\n3. **Ablation Studies:**\n   - The ablation studies are well-conducted and confirm the importance of hierarchical-VAE structure and hybrid attention mechanism.\n   - However, it might be beneficial to include results from removing other components (e.g., different parts of the attention mechanism or specific layers in the VAE) to ensure a comprehensive understanding of which aspects contribute most to performance.\n\n4. **Deterministic Alignment Predictor:**\n   - The deterministic alignment predictor (DAP) achieving similar MOS scores but lacking diversity is an interesting observation.\n   - **Exploration of Diversity:** It would be valuable to explore how DAP could be modified or combined with VAE-based predictors to enhance diversity while maintaining quality.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n\n- **Enhanced Statistical Analysis:** Add statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) for the MOS scores comparisons between EFTS2 and other models.\n- **Qualitative Assessments:** Include qualitative assessments alongside MOS scores to provide a more complete picture of model performance.\n- **Ablation Studies Depth:** Conduct ablation studies on additional components and report findings to further validate design choices.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nWhile the authors have conducted thorough evaluations and provided compelling evidence for the quality of their models, the inclusion of more detailed statistical analysis and qualitative assessments would strengthen the paper. The proposed improvements will ensure that the results are as robust and transparent as possible.\n\n**Decision: Accept with Revisions**\n\nI recommend accepting this submission subject to addressing the suggestions mentioned above.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this person as Reviewer 95 for their paper. The section they're reviewing is about comparing EFTS2 with some baseline models using MOS scores. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the subsection compares EFTS2 against VITS and another EFTS model in their family. They mention using a 5-scale MOS evaluation on the LJ-Speech dataset. From what I know, MOS is a standard way to measure perceived audio quality, so that's good. The fact that EFTS2 outperforms one of the models but not both could be significant.\n\nI notice they conducted ablation studies. That's important because it shows whether their design choices are actually contributing to the results. They removed certain components like hierarchical-VAE and hybrid attention and saw a drop in MOS, which is good evidence that those parts add value. It makes sense because without them, performance goes down.\n\nBut wait, why did EFTS2 not outperform both VITS and their own model? Maybe there are limitations or specific scenarios where it's better or worse. They should probably discuss this more to show a comprehensive understanding of how EFTS2 stacks up against others in the field.\n\nThe part about DAP vs. VAE-PCT\u2014mentioning that DAP has similar scores but lacks diversity is interesting. It points out a potential trade-off between quality and diversity, which could be an important design consideration for future models.\n\nI'm also thinking about the structure of their section. It's clear they present results first before diving into analysis. That makes sense because it follows a typical research paper flow. But maybe adding more context on why EFTS-CNN + Hifi-GAN was chosen as a baseline would strengthen their argument, especially if that model is not commonly used in the field.\n\nAnother thing to consider: they might want to highlight how their ablation studies contribute beyond just confirming component importance. Perhaps they can show which components are most critical for performance and discuss implications for future research or applications.\n\nAlso, the conclusion mentions speech quality being close to ground truth, which is a strong point because it shows EFTS2 is realistic. But maybe they could provide examples of how EFTS2's limitations might affect real-world applications compared to VITS.\n\nI should also think about any gaps in their analysis. For example, do the limitations apply across different languages or accents? Could there be other areas where EFTS-CNN + Hifi-GAN excels that EFTS2 doesn't?\n\nLastly, I wonder if they have considered statistical significance for the MOS scores. If the differences are small, maybe they aren't practically significant even if statistically significant.\n\nOverall, their study is solid with some strong points about model performance and component importance, but there's room for deeper analysis of the trade-offs and broader implications.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe reviewer's analysis effectively demonstrates that EFTS2 outperforms existing models in certain aspects while highlighting its limitations. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the necessity of specific components, which strengthens the paper's argument. Although further discussion on potential trade-offs and real-world applications could enhance the paper, the provided evidence is sufficient to accept the submission."

As a Distinguished Leader and Expert in this field, I would like to provide my critical feedback for improvement.\n\n   Firstly, I commend you for presenting the significant reduction in model size and increase in inference speed compared to the baseline models. However, I am concerned about the comparison with VITS (Variable-length Transformer with Infinite Skip Connections) as a single baseline model, especially since there are numerous other state-of-the-art generative models available in this domain.

                "llama3.2": "The paper claims to present significant improvements in model size and inference speed for the proposed hierarchical-VAE-based generator. The key argument is that by employing a smaller number of convolution blocks in the generator compared to VITS, EFTS2 achieves substantial gains.\n\nUpon initial review, I agree with Reviewer 78's comment regarding the importance of model architecture details on performance. It is crucial to ensure that the proposed changes are indeed responsible for the observed improvements.\n\nHowever, I disagree with some aspects of the paper's argumentation. Firstly, it would be beneficial to provide more rigorous validation of the performance gains obtained by EFTS2 compared to VITS. While the inference speed improvement might seem promising at first glance, it is essential to demonstrate that this comes at the cost of compromising on model accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, I am skeptical about the claim that employing fewer convolution blocks in the generator leads directly to a significant reduction in model size. A more comprehensive analysis would be necessary to confirm whether the proposed hierarchical-VAE architecture truly achieves these benefits.\n\nLastly, it would be helpful to discuss potential limitations or challenges associated with using such architectures for real-world applications.

Are there any potential trade-offs in terms of increased computational requirements during training?\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge some aspects of the paper's argumentation, I believe that further validation and analysis are needed to fully support these claims.\n\n**Final Decision:** Reject",

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this section about EFTS2's performance compared to VITS. The reviewer says that because EFTS2 uses fewer convolution blocks in its generator, it's both smaller and faster than the baseline models like VITS. They mention a specific frequency of 2247.52 kHz, which is 1.5 times faster.\n\nHmm, I'm not super familiar with these models, but I know that convolutional blocks typically involve multiple layers and operations. So using fewer might mean less computation needed, right? That would make the model faster and more efficient in terms of memory or parameters, hence smaller size.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to attribute such a significant speed difference solely to having fewer blocks? Maybe there's more to EFTS2's architecture that contributes to its performance. I wonder if they considered other factors like optimizer settings or hardware used during testing. If the comparison was done under ideal conditions for VITS but not for EFTS2, that might skew the results.\n\nAlso, looking at Table 3 would have been helpful to see the exact numbers and how significant these differences are. Without that, it's hard to tell if a 1.5x speed improvement is substantial or just minor. If they're comparing apples to oranges in terms of training environments or computational resources, that could affect the outcome.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether EFTS2's design introduces any trade-offs. For example, maybe while it's faster and smaller, does it have lower accuracy or affect some other performance metrics? The abstract mentions focusing on inference speed, but perhaps they should also discuss other aspects like training time or model size in parameters.\n\nI'm also thinking about the evaluation methodology. Were both models trained under the same conditions? If EFTS2 uses a different architecture that could be more efficient inherently, maybe it's not just the number of blocks but other structural decisions that led to better performance. Maybe fewer blocks don't always mean less computation because each block can still have many operations.\n\nSo, in summary, while using fewer convolution blocks does contribute to faster inference speed and a smaller model size, it's important to consider if there are other factors at play. The reviewer should provide more details on the comparison setup, other performance metrics, and how these architectural choices affect different aspects of the model's functionality.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of EFTS2's performance compared to VITS highlights its efficiency due to fewer convolutional blocks, leading to faster inference speed and a smaller model size. However, to fully validate this improvement, it is crucial to consider other factors such as evaluation methodology, computational resources used, and potential trade-offs in accuracy or training time. Additionally, the abstract should ideally include broader performance metrics beyond just inference speed.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe reviewer's conclusion about EFTS2's efficiency is reasonable given its architecture, but additional context on the comparison setup and other performance aspects would strengthen their argument. Since these details are not provided in the current analysis, the decision to accept the submission stands with the understanding that further investigation into the evaluation methodology and model comprehensiveness could enhance the study's robustness."

Their results show slightly better MOS scores and similarity scores on seen speakers but only comparable or slightly worse on unseen speakers.\n\nI'm thinking about what these metrics mean. MOS is a measure of perceived quality, so higher is better. Similarity scores probably assess how close the converted speech is to the original. EFTS2-VC does better for known speakers, which makes sense if they're speaker-adaptive\u2014they can tailor their model better to specific accents or dialects.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about the speed difference. If EFTS2-VC runs 2.15x faster than YourTTS, that's a significant improvement. But why isn't this more highlighted in the results? Maybe they didn't focus on speed as much in their evaluation.\n\nAnother point is how they compared YourTTS. Since YourTTS requires bidirectional flow modules for conversion, it might not be optimal. Perhaps EFTS2-VC could benefit from further optimization or comparison with other models that don't have this dependency.\n\nAlso, the dataset used has a specific number of speakers\u2014139 male and 40 female\u2014in a particular language. The results are good but only tested on a subset. If they had broader speaker coverage or different languages, it might make their model more robust.\n\nI wonder if there's a trade-off between speed and quality that wasn't discussed. Maybe EFTS2-VC could convert faster without sacrificing too much in perceived quality for unseen speakers?\n\nThe conclusion says EFTS2-VC is significantly faster but doesn't address whether the loss of similarity on unseen speakers affects user perception. It might be worth exploring if users experience noticeable differences when converting texts from unknown speakers.\n\nOverall, their findings are promising, especially the speed improvement, but there are areas where they could enhance the evaluation to show a more balanced performance across all scenarios.\n</think>\n\nThe evaluation of EFTS2-VC against YourTTS on the VCTK dataset highlights several key points:\n\n1. **Performance Metrics**: \n   - EFTS2-VC demonstrates slightly better MOS scores and similarity for seen speakers, indicating improved quality and fidelity when converting known speech patterns.\n   - For unseen speakers, the performance is comparable but not superior, suggesting potential limitations in generalization.\n\n2. **Speed Considerations**:\n   - The significant speed improvement (2.15x faster) over YourTTS could be a critical factor for practical applications where efficiency is paramount.\n\n3. **Comparison Context**:\n   - The reliance of YourTTS on bidirectional flow modules might not represent its optimal performance, potentially affecting the comparison's fairness or relevance.\n\n4. **Dataset Limitations**:\n   - The evaluation is conducted on a specific dataset with limited speaker diversity (139 male and 40 female speakers), which may restrict generalizability to broader populations.\n\n5. **Trade-offs**:\n   - While EFTS2-VC offers substantial speed benefits, the impact of its slightly lower similarity for unseen speakers should be considered in terms of user perception and practical application scenarios.\n\n6. **Future Directions**:\n   - Investigating whether users perceive a significant quality loss when converting from unknown speakers could provide deeper insights into the model's applicability.\n\nIn conclusion, EFTS2-VC shows promising performance, particularly in speed, but further evaluation is needed to balance its perceived quality across diverse speaker populations."

Increasing `t2` (scaling factor on `z2`) barely produces any variation in F0, even when `t1` is large.\n\n**Insights:**\n\n1. The model learns a hierarchical representation of acoustic information, where `p\u03b8(z1)` provides variations in spectrogram domain acoustic information, while `p\u03b8(z2)` provides variations in time domain information.\n2.

The model's ability to learn hierarchical and explainable latent representations is crucial for generating diverse audios with controlled acoustic features, such as F0 contours.\n2. This finding supports the idea that the proposed generator can effectively capture the complexities of human speech without requiring explicit constraints or guidance.\n\nOverall, this passage provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of the proposed generator's hierarchical architecture, highlighting its potential for generating diverse audios with controllable acoustic features.",

I must commend you on the innovative approach; however, there are certain aspects that require further clarification and improvement.\n\n   In Section 2.2.2, you discuss the controllable diversity in the hierarchical and explainable latent variables. While I understand your point about the impact of t1 and t2 on F0 variations, I found it challenging to completely agree with your interpretation of the role of p\u03b8(z1) and p\u03b8(z2).\n\n   Regarding p\u03b8(z1), you state that it offers variations in the spectrogram domain acoustic information. While the increase in variation of F0 as t1 increases suggests this, I would have appreciated more concrete evidence or an explanation of how the spectrogram domain is affected by z1. Furthermore, your statement about p\u03b8(z2) containing spectrogram domain and time-domain information seems a bit contradictory. If it contains time-domain information, shouldn't it also impact F0?\n\n   Additionally, you mention that the model learns hierarchical and explainable latent representations without explicit constraints. I find this claim intriguing but would require more evidence to support it, such as visualizations of the learned representations or a discussion on how the model implicitly learns these hierarchies.\n\n   To improve the paper, I suggest providing more in-depth analysis and examples of how p\u03b8(z1) and p\u03b8(z2) affect different aspects of the audio synthesis process, including time-domain information like F0, spectral properties, and other important features.

                "llama3.2": "I'd like to start by saying that I appreciate the effort put into explaining the hierarchical architecture of the proposed generator and its ability to produce controllable diversity in latent variables. However, I have some concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nFirstly, I would like to clarify why the authors conclude that $p\\theta(z_1)$ is a linguistic latent representation offering variations on the spectrogram domain acoustic information, while $p\\theta(z_2)$ contains the spectrogram domain acoustic information and offers variations on time domain information. It seems to me that this conclusion may be too hasty. While it's true that increasing $t_1$ increases the variation of F0, it doesn't necessarily mean that $z_1$ is a linguistic latent representation. The authors should provide more evidence or arguments to support this claim.\n\nFurthermore, I am not entirely convinced by the analysis presented in Figure 3. While it shows some interesting results, it lacks rigor and does not provide a clear understanding of how the parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ affect the distribution of $z_1$ and $z_2$. For example, what is the significance of using only 5 pairs of $z_1$ and $z_2$ for each pair of $t_1$ and $t_2$? This seems like a very small sample size, which may not be representative of the entire distribution.\n\nI also have some concerns about the interpretation of the results. The authors claim that increasing $t_1$ increases the variation of F0, while decreasing $t_2$ has little effect on it. However, this conclusion seems to me to be based on a limited analysis and does not take into account other factors that may influence F0, such as pitch accent or stress.\n\nTo address these concerns, I would suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of their results and methods, including more rigorous analyses and larger sample sizes. They should also provide more evidence to support their claims about the nature of $p\\theta(z_1)$ and $p\\theta(z_2)$. Additionally, they could explore alternative interpretations of their results and consider potential limitations or biases in their analysis.\n\nIn light of these concerns, I would like to see the authors revise and resubmit their paper.

Specifically:\n\n- **Explanation of Latent Variables**: While it's clear that increasing \\( t_1 \\) increases F0 variation, a bit more context on what exactly \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) represent would strengthen this section. For example, explaining if \\( z_1 \\) corresponds to phonemic or prosodic information could help readers understand the underlying linguistic structure better.\n\n- **Figure 3**: The scatter plots in Figure 3 are a good visual aid but need more detailed labeling and annotation. It would be helpful to label each point with corresponding values of \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\), and perhaps even provide a legend explaining how the colors or sizes represent different parameter settings.\n\n- **Interpretation of Results**: The statement that \"essential acoustic features such as F0 are mostly fixed after z1 is sampled\" seems somewhat strong. Could you provide more evidence or examples to support this claim? For instance, maybe include some quantitative metrics showing the degree of variation in F0 and other relevant features.\n\n- **Hierarchical Nature**: While the hierarchical nature of \\( p_\u03b8(z_1) \\) and \\( p_\u03b8(z_2) \\) is discussed, could you elaborate on how these latent variables interact or influence each other? For example, does sampling from both distributions together produce more varied results compared to just one?\n\nTo address any potential criticisms:\n\n- **Consistency in Experiments**: Ensure that the experiments are consistent across different settings of \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\). Any variations should be accounted for.\n  \n- **Comprehensive Analysis**: A thorough analysis of the impact of these latent variables on other acoustic features like pitch, duration, and formants would also strengthen this section.\n\nIn summary, I believe with some additional clarifications and detailed explanations, this section could become even more compelling.

This suggests that p\u03b8(z1) handles variations on the spectrogram level, while p\u03b8(z2) affects time domain info.

                "llama3.2": "Thank you for providing the paper, \"EfficientTTS 2\" (EFTS2), which presents a novel end-to-end TTS model adopting an adversarial training process. As Reviewer 95, I'll provide my critical feedback on this manuscript.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to acknowledge the previous reviewer's comment that highlighted the novelty of the B2A approach in replacing conventional upsampling techniques. I agree with their assessment that this approach has potential benefits, particularly its differentiability and computational efficiency. However, I have some concerns regarding the scope of this contribution. While it's true that EFTS2 can be incorporated into other TTS frameworks, I wonder if the authors have exhaustively explored all possible applications of B2A or if there are potential limitations to its generalizability.\n\nMoving on to the differentiable aligner, I appreciate the emphasis on improving the uniformity of the model and making the training process end-to-end. This aspect is crucial for achieving high-quality speech generation. Nevertheless, I think it would be beneficial to provide more insight into how this aligner compares to existing external aligners or non-differentiable aligners in terms of performance and computational cost.\n\nRegarding the 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator, I share the author's enthusiasm for its potential to outperform popular flow-VAE-based counterparts. However, I'd like to see more detailed analyses of their experimental results to substantiate this claim. Are there any specific metrics or evaluation protocols that demonstrate the superiority of EFTS2-VC over existing models?\n\nLastly, I appreciate the authors' pragmatic approach to leaving assumptions and limitations for future work. This is a crucial aspect of scientific inquiry, as it allows for the exploration of new ideas while acknowledging potential pitfalls.\n\nIn conclusion, while EFTS2 presents an innovative TTS model with several attractive features, there are some areas that require further development or substantiation. I'd like to suggest the following:\n\n* Provide more detailed experimental results to demonstrate the performance advantages of B2A and the 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator.\n* Investigate potential limitations or scope constraints on the applications of B2A in TTS frameworks.\n* Consider incorporating more robust evaluation protocols and metrics to assess the effectiveness of EFTS2-VC.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept",
                "qwen2.5": "Hey there,\n\nThe section you've shared is pretty exciting! It's clear that EFTS2 introduces some innovative solutions to TTS and VC tasks. However, I have a few critical points to raise.\n\nFirstly, the claims about EFTS2 being \"fully differentiable\" and offering \"higher model efficiency\" without explicitly comparing it against other state-of-the-art models are a bit vague. To substantiate these claims, you really need concrete comparisons or benchmarks against established TTS architectures like Tacotron 2, FastSpeech, or even more recent ones like HiFi-GAN variants. Providing such comparisons would strengthen your argument and make the model's benefits more tangible.\n\nSecondly, while the B2A approach is indeed a potential game-changer for NAR models, you should provide some empirical evidence to back up this claim. How does it fare in terms of performance metrics like PESQ or CSIG compared to traditional upsampling techniques? And can you discuss any limitations of your B2A approach that might hinder its widespread adoption?\n\nMoving on, the differentiable aligner sounds like a valuable addition, but there's no discussion about how this compares to other alignment strategies (e.g., using attention mechanisms). Also, while you mention that it improves uniformity and training efficiency, I would be more convinced if you could provide some concrete examples or case studies where it outperforms non-differentiable aligners.\n\nRegarding the hierarchical-VAE-based speech generator, your statement that it \"can potentially outperform\" existing flow-VAE architectures is quite broad. You should include more detailed comparisons and metrics to support this assertion. Additionally, while flexibility in network design is appealing, you need to be clear about how this translates into practical benefits for real-world applications.\n\nLastly, the claim that EFTS2 could serve as a \"practical solution\" for sequence-to-sequence tasks with monotonic alignments might be too broad without concrete examples or case studies. It would be more convincing if you can provide specific scenarios where your model outperforms others in such tasks.\n\nIn summary, while I appreciate the innovative nature of EFTS2, there's a need for stronger experimental validation and comparison against existing models to fully convince potential readers about its superiority and practicality.\n\n**Final Decision:** Reject\n\nI hope these comments are helpful.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I've been given this paper to review. It's about an improved TTS model called EfficientTTS 2 (EFTS2), which they say is better than their previous version and other baseline models. The main points are that EFTS2 uses adversarial training with a generator composed of two parts: a differentiable aligner and a hierarchical VAE-based speech generator. They mention it's fully differentiable, smaller in size, more efficient, and still does high-quality speech generation with controllable diversity.\n\nThe paper also extends this model to VC (voice conversion), creating EFTS2-VC, which is efficient for voice conversion tasks. The authors argue that their approach has several advantages over existing methods: the B2A aligner is cheaper than upsampling techniques, the differentiable aligner improves model uniformity and end-to-end training, and the two-layer hierarchical VAE is more efficient than flow-based models.\n\nBut I'm not sure if all these claims are backed up. For example, while they talk about being computationally cheap, I would need to see how that compares in practice\u2014like actual performance metrics or comparisons with other methods. Also, the differentiable aligner part seems promising, but is it really better than existing options? Maybe there's some bias towards their method without enough evidence.\n\nThe VAE part mentions efficiency and flexibility, which sounds good, but I wonder about specific experimental results showing that it outperforms flow-based models in terms of both performance and computational resources. It would help to see if the trade-offs are justified\u2014like how much does having two layers affect inference speed or model size compared to using a single flow layer.\n\nThe extension to VC is interesting, but I'm curious about the specific experiments they did for this task. How does EFTS2-VC perform in real-world scenarios? Are there any limitations mentioned?\n\nAlso, the abstract mentions that the architecture could serve as a practical solution for tasks with monotonic alignments, but isn't most TTS based on non-monotonic alignments due to the way text is converted into speech? Maybe they're using specific modifications or approximations here.\n\nThe conclusion seems strong in highlighting their contributions and leaving future work open, which is good. But I'm concerned about whether all these improvements are necessary together or if some could be addressed separately without compromising performance.\n\nI think I need to see more detailed experiments comparing each component's effect on the overall model\u2014like ablation studies showing how removing any part still maintains performance. Also, perhaps they should address potential limitations in scalability or real-time applications since efficiency is a key point for TTS models.\n\nOverall, while there are several innovative aspects and claimed benefits, I'm not entirely convinced without more concrete evidence of their performance improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the paper and considering the points raised in my critique, I believe the contributions of EFTS2 are significant. The model introduces an efficient adversarial training process with a novel architecture combining a differentiable aligner and a hierarchical VAE-based generator. This approach offers improvements in computational efficiency, model size, and high-quality speech generation, which are substantial additions to the field of TTS.\n\nThe extension to voice conversion (EFTS2-VC) is another notable contribution, providing an efficient solution for this task. The authors' claims about their method's advantages over existing techniques are compelling, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness and flexibility.\n\nWhile there could be room for more detailed comparisons with other methods across various metrics and additional experimental validation, especially concerning trade-offs between performance and computational efficiency, the paper presents a solid foundation that could lead to further advancements. The potential benefits of their approach seem significant enough to warrant acceptance, provided the authors are encouraged to address any concerns regarding robustness and scalability through further experiments.\n\n**Accept**"

The codebase itself needs to be well-documented, including explanations of each component, hyperparameters, and any assumptions made during development.\n\nAdditionally, I would have liked to see more information on the evaluation protocols used for both EFTS2 and EFTS2-VC. How did you choose the metrics to evaluate performance? Were there any other metrics considered that didn't make it into the final report?

The use of public datasets such as LJ Speech and VCTK for experiments is a sound choice, providing a solid foundation for comparison with other models.\n\nHowever, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the quality and clarity of your work:\n\n1. **Dataset Preprocessing**: It would be beneficial to expand on why specific parameters were chosen for Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) in obtaining linear spectrograms. Providing insights into the influence of these values on the performance of your model could add valuable context and contribute to reproducibility.\n\n2. **Model Configurations**: While the detailed descriptions of the model configurations are appreciated, it would be helpful to see a visual representation (e.g., architecture diagram) that clearly shows the structure of EFTS2 and EFTS2-VC, including the number of layers, hidden sizes, and any other critical components.\n\n3. **Training**: It would strengthen your paper if you explain how the choice of GPU configuration and batch size impacts the training process and convergence of your models. Additionally, providing more detail on why specific optimizers (AdamW) were chosen could be informative for other researchers.\n\n4. **MOS Evaluation**: Although the use of MOS tests to evaluate model performance is a common practice, it would be helpful to understand how the 15 raters were selected and if there are any potential biases in their evaluations that may affect the results.\n\nIn terms of alignment with previous reviewer comments, I agree with the need for a visual representation of the model architecture. The use of a 5-point Likert scale score is appropriate, but more detail on rater selection would indeed be beneficial.\n\nWith these revisions, I believe that your paper could significantly contribute to the field and merit consideration for acceptance.

It would be beneficial to provide more context on why these datasets were chosen and how they relate to the research question.\n\nRegarding the preprocessing step, I agree with previous reviewer that the FFT size, hop size, and window size could be justified with more explanation. Specifically, the authors mention using a hop size of 256, which is relatively large compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Could they elaborate on why this choice was made?\n\nIn terms of model configurations, I appreciate the detail provided in Table 4, but I would have liked to see more justification for certain hyperparameter choices. For instance, the number of convolution layers in the VAP encoder and decoder seems arbitrary without further explanation.\n\nI also noticed that the authors use a pre-trained speaker recognition model as part of their architecture, which is not explicitly stated. It would be helpful to provide more information on why this choice was made and how it relates to the overall research question.\n\nRegarding training, I agree with previous reviewer that using 4 Tesla V100 GPUs with 16G memory is an overkill for many experiments. Could the authors explain why they chose these specific hardware configurations?\n\nFinally, I would like to see more information on the evaluation metrics used in this study. Specifically, what is being measured by the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluations? How were these scores calculated and what are their implications for the research question?\n\nIn light of my criticisms, I would recommend that the authors revise their manuscript to address these concerns.\n\nFinal Decision: \n\nAccept",
                "qwen2.5": "Hey there,\n\nFirst off, let me say that I appreciate the thoroughness in detailing both datasets used. However, I have some concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nStarting with the datasets, you mention using two public ones: LJ Speech and VCTK. While these are indeed well-established, I think it would be beneficial to provide a bit more context on why specific characteristics of these datasets were chosen. For instance, could we explain why the single-speaker nature of the LJ dataset was selected over the multi-speaker VCTK? Moreover, while you've mentioned that the audio clips are down-sampled from 44kHz to 22050Hz, it might be worth discussing any potential trade-offs or impacts on model performance due to this resampling.\n\nMoving on to the preprocessing section, your choice of using linear spectrograms as input for the spectrogram encoder is sound. However, I'd like to see more detailed information on why you chose specific parameters for Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). For example, can we justify the FFT size and hop size? Additionally, the use of phonemizer 2 for text-to-phoneme conversion seems appropriate but perhaps it would be good to mention any potential limitations or issues that might arise from this choice.\n\nRegarding model configurations, you've provided a detailed breakdown which is appreciated. However, I think it's important to explain why certain choices were made in the configuration of EFTS2 and EFTS2-VC. For instance, the justification for having 6 Feed-Forward Transformer (FFT) blocks in the phoneme encoder could be clearer. Also, while the HiFi-GAN generator shares similar configurations with previous work by Kong et al., it would help to highlight any specific modifications or improvements made.\n\nOn training details, your setup seems solid, but I'd like to see some discussion on potential issues that might arise from using a small batch size of 32. Could there be any trade-offs in model performance due to this choice? Additionally, the use of AdamW optimizer is great, and the learning rate decay schedule appears well-defined. However, it would be useful to discuss how sensitive the models are to these hyperparameters.\n\nLastly, regarding MOS evaluation, your approach is fine but consider including more information about the raters' background or experience if possible. This could affect the reliability of the MOS scores.\n\nWith those points noted, I believe with some additional context and justification in the manuscript, we can strengthen its overall quality.\n\nDecision: **Reject**\n\nI'd suggest addressing these concerns before resubmission.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to help this user by reviewing their paper. They mentioned that they're using two datasets: LJ Speech and VCTK. I should check if these are standard datasets. LJ Speech is commonly used in speech synthesis research, so that's fine. However, VCTK might not be as widely recognized compared to something like LJS or SwitchAll. Maybe the authors could compare against more standard datasets to strengthen their claims.\n\nLooking at preprocessing, they're using STFT with specific parameters\u20141024 FFT size, 256 hop size, and 1024 window size. That seems reasonable for capturing speech features, but I wonder if there's any consideration of variable speaker characteristics in the VCTK dataset that might affect performance.\n\nThe model architecture details are quite technical. They have a phoneme encoder with 6 FFT blocks, each having multi-head attention and convolutional layers. The HiFi-GAN and WaveNet components also seem standard for high-quality audio generation. However, I'm not sure about the reasoning behind choosing these specific hyperparameters in the text. It might be beneficial to explain how they were selected or why certain choices were made.\n\nThe training setup is detailed: 4 GPUs with batch size 32 each, using AdamW optimizer and learning rate schedule. They mention both models converge at 500k steps, but without validation curves or ablation studies, it's hard to assess convergence speed and model stability.\n\nMOS evaluation is conducted with 15 raters on a 5-point scale. That's thorough, but maybe adding more statistical analysis of the results could make the evaluation stronger, like confidence intervals or paired t-tests.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a solid framework with specific technical details, but areas for improvement include comparing to broader datasets, justifying hyperparameter choices, and providing deeper validation analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe paper under review presents a detailed investigation into the performance of EFTS2-VC compared to other speech synthesis models. The authors have conducted extensive experiments using two public datasets (LJ Speech and VCTK) and provided a thorough description of their methodology, model architecture, training setup, and evaluation process.\n\n### Key Findings and Suggestions:\n1. **Datasets**: \n   - The use of LJ Speech is appropriate for evaluating speech synthesis models.\n   - The VCTK dataset, while useful, contains multiple speakers with varying accents, which could introduce variability in the evaluation results. Comparing against more standard datasets like LJS or SwitchAll might provide a more robust assessment.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - The preprocessing steps using STFT are reasonable but could be improved by including additional details on how the audio segments were selected and split into training, validation, and test sets.\n\n3. **Model Architecture**:\n   - The model architecture is complex and well-detailed, but there is limited justification for why certain components (e.g., specific layer sizes or numbers of attention heads) were chosen. This could be addressed by explaining the rationale behind these design choices.\n\n4. **Training Setup**:\n   - The training details are clear, but additional information on hyperparameter sensitivity and model convergence during training would strengthen the paper.\n\n5. **Evaluation**:\n   - The MOS evaluation is thorough, but including statistical analysis of the results (e.g., confidence intervals or paired t-tests) could provide stronger evidence for the findings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper presents a well-structured investigation into the performance of EFTS2-VC, with detailed methodology and evaluation. However, there are areas where additional clarity and justification would enhance the paper's strength and impact. Specifically, comparing against broader datasets, providing deeper justification for hyperparameter choices, and including statistical analysis of the evaluation results would add valuable insights to the research.\n\n**Final Decision**: Accept"

            "Test": "It appears that you're discussing some specific research findings related to Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, specifically a variant called EFTS2 (Efficient Feed-Forward TTS). The text provides two main points:\n\n1. **Visualization of Attention Matrices**: Figure 5 shows the attention matrices for \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2), which are used in the EFTS2 model. These matrices represent how the model focuses on different input tokens during processing. Notably, both matrices exhibit monotonic behavior, indicating that the model can learn clean boundaries between tokens.\n   - **\u03b1(1)**: This attention matrix learns a smoother alignment between input tokens, suggesting it might be more adept at handling continuous audio signals or providing more even tone shifts.\n\n2. **Training Loss Comparison**: Figure 6 compares the performance of two different TTS models based on their architecture:\n   - A 1-layer VAE-based generator.\n   - A 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based generator.\n   The comparison highlights that adding an additional layer in the variational autoencoder (VAE) structure results in significant improvements in both KL divergence loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss. This implies better model flexibility, robustness, and potentially improved audio quality.\n\nThese findings suggest that incorporating deeper VAE structures into TTS models can lead to more efficient training processes, reduced losses, and possibly higher-quality generated audio.",

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have reviewed your paper and I must say that it has some promising aspects, but there are areas that require improvement to meet the standards expected in our field.\n\nFirstly, regarding section C.1, \"Visualization of the Attention Matrices,\" I find the explanation satisfactory for the most part. However, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed analysis and interpretation of the visualized results. The monotonicity of \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) is mentioned, but the implications of this property on the performance of EFTS2 are not discussed. Additionally, while it's stated that \u03b1(2) learns clean boundaries for input tokens, it would be helpful to see an example or provide additional context to support this claim. Regarding \u03b1(1), the term \"smooth alignment\" is used, but again, a more in-depth explanation of what constitutes a smooth alignment and how it contributes to the model's performance would be appreciated.\n\nMoving on to section C.2, \"Training Loss Comparison,\" I find the comparison of the model performance between the TTS models using different generators informative. However, it is crucial to provide more insight into the implications of the significant decrease in KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss when using a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE based generator compared to a 1-layer VAE based generator. Does this result in better speech synthesis quality? If so, how can this be quantified or demonstrated? Furthermore, it would be helpful to see the actual visualized comparisons of the training loss rather than just stating that they are shown in Figure 6.\n\nIn conclusion, I suggest revising your paper to include more detailed analysis and interpretation of the results presented.

                "llama3.2": "The section on visualization of attention matrices and training loss comparison. Let's dive in.\n\nFirstly, I appreciate that the authors have chosen to visualize the attention matrices, as it provides a clearer understanding of how their proposed EFTS2 model captures input tokens and aligns them for text-to-speech synthesis. However, I'm not entirely convinced by the monotonicity claim for \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2). While it's true that \u03b1(2) exhibits clean boundaries for input tokens, I would have liked to see more explicit justification or evidence supporting this assertion. Perhaps a table or appendix detailing the specific token alignment patterns and corresponding attention weights could provide additional context?\n\nMoving on to the training loss comparison in Figure 6, I agree with previous reviewer's comments that incorporating a hierarchical-VAE structure can significantly improve performance. The visualizations of KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss indeed show a decrease, which suggests that the proposed EFTS2 model has some advantages over traditional VAE-based generators. However, I would have liked to see more quantitative comparisons, such as comparing the performance metrics (e.g., mean squared error or peak signal-to-noise ratio) between the two models. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the benefits and trade-offs of incorporating hierarchical structure.\n\nRegarding potential future work, it might be interesting to explore the impact of different hyperparameters, model architectures, or training strategies on the performance of EFTS2. Additionally, it's essential to consider the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach, as this could be a bottleneck for widespread adoption.\n\nIn conclusion, while the section provides some valuable insights into the proposed EFTS2 model, I believe that more detailed justifications, quantitative comparisons, and exploration of potential future directions are necessary to fully support the authors' claims.\n\nFinal decision: Accept.",
                "qwen2.5": "Sure, let's dive into this section. \n\n### C.1 VISUALIZATION OF THE ATTENTION MATRICES\n\nThis is a straightforward description but could benefit from some additional context and detail.\n\n- **Critique**: The statement that both \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) are monotonic doesn't provide much insight unless you explain what \"monotonic\" means in this context. Are these attention weights? And why do they need to be monotonic?\n  \n  - *Recommendation*: Elaborate on the concept of monotonicity here. For instance, if it refers to the attention scores being consistently increasing or decreasing across certain dimensions, explain that clearly.\n\n- **Critique**: The description of \u03b1(2) learning \"clean boundaries\" and \u03b1(1) producing a \"more smooth alignment\" is somewhat vague without further explanation.\n  \n  - *Recommendation*: Provide more details on what constitutes \"clean boundaries\" in this context.

Similarly, explain why a smoother alignment would be desirable.\n\n### C.2 TRAINING LOSS COMPARISON\n\nThis section is quite good but could be improved with some additional analysis and discussion.\n\n- **Critique**: The visualizations show significant decreases in both KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss when moving from 1-layer to 2-layer hierarchical VAE-based generators.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to review this paper section as Reviewer 95. The paper is about an EFTS2 model, which I'm not super familiar with, but they've provided enough context here.\n\nLooking at C.1 first: they visualize the attention matrices in Figure 5 and say that both \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) are monotonic. They mention that \u03b1(2) learns clean boundaries while \u03b1(1) is smoother. Hmm, I'm not sure what \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) represent here. Are these parameters from the model? Maybe they control different aspects of attention in their hierarchical VAE-based generator.\n\nNow C.2 compares two models: one with a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based generator versus a 1-layer VAE-based one, using training loss for TTS performance. The figures show that adding another variational layer reduces both KL and mel-spectrogram losses significantly. That makes sense because more layers can capture more complex distributions, so the model should perform better.\n\nBut wait, are there any potential issues here? Let me think about common concerns in VAE-based models. One thing I remember is that deeper or more complex architectures might lead to mode collapse or increased KL divergence if not properly regularized. But here, they're seeing a decrease in both losses with the additional layer, which suggests it's beneficial.\n\nAnother point: do they compare against other models? The abstract and introduction don't mention any baselines beyond their own previous work. Without a comparison to another model, like a standard VAE or a different hierarchical structure, it's hard to say if this improvement is significant. Maybe the figure 6 would show some benchmarks.\n\nAlso, could there be an issue with how they're measuring convergence? They only mention two losses but perhaps not other metrics that are important for TTS, like phone accuracy or F0 estimation. It might be beneficial to include those in their evaluation to get a more comprehensive picture of model performance.\n\nIn terms of the figures themselves, I'm not sure about the quality without seeing them, but if they clearly show the improvements as stated, then it's good evidence for the model's enhanced capabilities.\n\nSo overall, while there are some areas that could be expanded upon with additional comparisons and metrics, the provided analysis in C.1 and C.2 supports their claims of improved performance with a more complex VAE structure.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the paper section by Reviewer 95 is thorough and provides valuable insights into the comparative study between two hierarchical-VAE-based models for TTS.\n\n**Review Summary:**\n\nC.1: The visualization of attention matrices in Figure 5 highlights that both \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) are monotonic, with \u03b1(2) learning clean boundaries and \u03b1(1) providing a smoother alignment. This suggests that the hierarchical structure contributes to improved model performance by capturing more nuanced patterns.\n\nC.2: Figure 6 demonstrates significant improvements in both KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss when transitioning from a 1-layer VAE-based generator to a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based generator, indicating enhanced modeling capabilities with additional layers.\n\n**Potential Areas for Improvement:**\n\nWhile the analysis is commendable, the paper could benefit from:\n- A comparison against alternative models beyond their previous work.\n- Inclusion of additional performance metrics relevant to TTS, such as phone accuracy and F0 estimation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided evidence supports the enhanced capabilities of the 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based model. However, incorporating further comparisons and metrics would strengthen the paper's argument.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe paper is acceptable for publication after addressing minor suggestions regarding additional comparative analysis and performance metrics."

            "Here are some open-ended questions about the paper:\n\n* What motivated researchers in the TTS field to focus on developing one-stage text-to-waveform models that can be trained without the need for mel-spectrograms?": {
                "1INTRODUCT": "Researchers in the TTS field focused on developing one-stage text-to-waveform models that can be trained without the need for mel-spectrograms, largely due to the disadvantages of traditional two-stage systems. Specifically, these systems come with several drawbacks, including:\n\n1. The acoustic model and neural vocoder cannot be optimized jointly, which often hurts the quality of the generated speech.\n2. The separate training pipeline complicates training and deployment, making it difficult for modeling downstream tasks.\n\nThese limitations led researchers to explore alternative approaches, such as one-stage text-to-waveform models that can learn to produce high-quality audio directly from text inputs without relying on intermediate mel-spectrograms.",
                "2METHOD": "Unfortunately, I don't have enough information from the provided system message to answer this question directly. However, based on general knowledge about the Text-to-Speech (TTS) field and research trends, I can provide an educated guess.\n\nOne motivation behind developing one-stage text-to-waveform models without the need for mel-spectrograms is likely due to the complexity of traditional TTS systems, which often require manual annotation and processing of audio features such as mel-spectrograms. These steps can be time-consuming and may not always produce high-quality results.\n\nMoreover, the use of mel-spectrograms can limit the flexibility and expressiveness of TTS models. By developing one-stage models that can directly generate waveforms from text, researchers aim to simplify the training process, reduce computational requirements, and potentially improve the efficiency and quality of TTS systems.\n\nHowever, without more specific information from the paper, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.",
                "2.1BACKGRO": "Based on my understanding of the system message, it seems that researchers in the Text-to-Speech (TTS) field focused on developing one-stage text-to-waveform models with the goal of improving efficiency and speed in speech synthesis. One common challenge in TTS is the need to compute mel-spectrograms from waveform data, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n\nBy focusing on one-stage models that can learn to directly map input text to waveform data without intermediate steps like mel-spectrogram generation, researchers aimed to reduce the computational requirements and accelerate training. This approach also allows for more flexible and efficient processing of variable-length input sequences, which is particularly important in TTS where input lengths can vary.\n\nAdditionally, by bypassing the mel-spectrogram step, researchers hope to improve the robustness of their models to various acoustic conditions and variations in speaker identity, making them more suitable for real-world applications.",

However, I can provide some general context and insights.\n\nThe development of one-stage text-to-waveform models is likely driven by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Efficiency**: Training a model on raw audio data without the need for mel-spectrograms can be more efficient than using pre-processing steps to extract spectral features.\n2. **Flexibility**: One-stage models can potentially handle variable-length input sequences and multiple speaking styles or languages, making them more versatile than traditional two-stage models that rely on mel-spectrograms.\n3. **Advances in Deep Learning**: Recent advances in deep learning techniques, such as attention mechanisms and waveNet-based architectures, have enabled the development of more sophisticated text-to-waveform models.\n4. **Reducing Data Requirements**: By bypassing the need for mel-spectrograms, one-stage models can potentially require less data to train, which is beneficial for applications where large datasets are scarce.\n\nWhile I couldn't find a specific answer to this question in the paper, it's likely that researchers in the TTS field focused on developing one-stage text-to-waveform models as part of broader efforts to improve efficiency, flexibility, and performance in speech synthesis.",

My training data only includes a summary of the paper discussing the EFTS2 model and its comparison to other models, but it does not provide insights into the broader context or motivations behind the research in this area.\n\nHowever, I can try to make an educated guess based on the general trends and advancements in TTS research. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing more efficient and effective text-to-speech systems that can generate high-quality speech without requiring large amounts of labeled data or complex pre-processing steps. One-stage models, which train the entire pipeline from text to waveform in a single pass, have shown promise in reducing the computational requirements and training time compared to traditional two-stage models.\n\nIt's possible that researchers in the TTS field were motivated by these advancements and sought to develop one-stage models that can be trained without the need for mel-spectrograms, which are often used as an intermediate representation in speech synthesis.

However, generating high-quality speech waveforms directly from text requires complex processing steps and large amounts of training data.\n\nThe proposed system message suggests that one-stage models can bypass these complexities by leveraging hierarchical latent representations. This implies that the motivation to focus on one-stage models was to overcome the challenges associated with traditional TTS methods, such as the need for mel-spectrograms, and to explore alternative approaches that can generate high-quality speech waveforms more efficiently.\n\nSpecifically, the motivation might have been driven by the desire to:\n\n1. Reduce the computational requirements and training data needs for TTS models.\n2. Improve the efficiency of text-to-waveform generation, enabling faster and more scalable TTS systems.\n3. Develop more interpretable and explainable models that can provide insights into the underlying relationships between text and speech.\n\nBy developing one-stage models that can be trained without mel-spectrograms, researchers in the TTS field aimed to create a more efficient, scalable, and potentially more effective approach for generating high-quality speech waveforms.",

However, I can provide some general insights.\n\nOne potential motivation for researchers to explore one-stage TTS models that can be trained without mel-spectrograms might be the desire to simplify the training process and reduce the complexity of the model architecture. Mel-spectrograms are often used as a critical component in traditional TTS models, serving as an intermediate representation between text input and waveform output. By developing one-stage models that can learn from raw waveforms or other representations directly, researchers might aim to:\n\n1. Reduce computational costs associated with training on large mel-spectrogram datasets.\n2. Improve the efficiency of model training and inference.\n3. Enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the model for different speaking styles, accents, or languages.\n\nAnother possible motivation could be the pursuit of more interpretable and explainable models. By bypassing the mel-spectrogram intermediate representation, researchers might aim to gain a better understanding of the relationships between text input and waveform output, leading to improved model performance and transparency.\n\nIt is also worth noting that recent advances in deep learning techniques, such as attention mechanisms and self-supervised learning methods, have made it possible to develop more sophisticated TTS models without relying on traditional mel-spectrogram-based approaches."

An acoustic model that transforms the input text sequence into mel-spectrogram features.\n2. A neural vocoder that takes these mel-spectrogram features and generates audio waveforms.\n\nIn contrast, NAR models bypass this intermediate step by directly mapping text inputs to audio waveforms through a single, unified model.\n\nThe key advantage of NAR models is that they can be trained end-to-end without the need for separate acoustic models and vocoders. This makes them more efficient, faster to train, and potentially more interpretable than traditional two-stage systems.\n\nIn the case of EfficientTTS (EFTS), it is indeed a notable example of an NAR framework that enables both differentiable alignment modeling and high-quality speech generation.

This prediction is done by a separate neural network that takes xh as input and outputs an estimate of \u03b1.\n\nThe predicted alignment vector \u03b1 is then used in place of the true \u03b1 to compute the output of the aligner.

When it comes to addressing the challenge of computing \u03b1 (attention weight) during inference when yh (the mel-encoder output) is unavailable, alignment vectors are used in a way that adapts to the specific requirements of this scenario.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Pretraining**: During pretraining, the model learns to predict the target sequence `yt` given an input sequence `xt`. This process involves computing attention weights \u03b1 using the encoder output `yh`, which is typically obtained from the mel-encoder (a type of neural network specifically designed for audio processing).\n\n2. **Alignment Vectors**: The alignment vectors are learned during pretraining and represent the relative importance of different positions in the input sequence `xt`. These vectors can be thought of as \"weights\" that indicate how much each position contributes to the overall output.\n\n3. **Inference Phase (Unavailability of yh)**: During inference, when the mel-encoder output `yh` is not available, the model relies on the alignment vectors learned during pretraining to adapt its behavior.\n\n4. **Attention Weight Computation**: In this scenario, instead of using `yh`, the model computes attention weights \u03b1 by applying a linear transformation to the input sequence `xt` and then scaling it with the alignment vectors. This process can be represented as follows:\n\n   - Take the input sequence `xt`.\n   - Apply a linear transformation (typically an affine transformation) to `xt`, which outputs a new set of values.\n   - Scale these transformed values by the alignment vectors. This operation emphasizes positions in `xt` that correspond to high-scoring alignment vectors.\n\n5. **Output**: The resulting scaled values represent the attention weights \u03b1, which can then be used for further processing (e.g., decoding).\n\nBy leveraging the prelearned alignment vectors during inference when `yh` is unavailable, this approach allows the model to effectively adapt and compute attention weights without relying on the mel-encoder output. This process enables the model to maintain its performance even in situations where `yh` cannot be obtained.\n\nPlease note that this explanation provides a high-level overview of how alignment vectors are applied during inference when `yh` is unavailable.

            "Here are some open-ended questions about the paper:\n\n1. How does the hybrid attention mechanism contribute to improving the performance of the differentiable aligner in EFTS?": {

However, based on my understanding of the paper, I can try to provide an answer.\n\nFrom what is mentioned in the paper, the hybrid attention mechanism is proposed as an improvement over the alignment framework of EFTS. The paper states that this mechanism enables the model to learn expressive latent time-aligned representations and have controllable diversity in speech rhythms.\n\nIt can be inferred that the hybrid attention mechanism improves the performance of the differentiable aligner by allowing it to better capture the complex relationships between the input text, the latent representation, and the output waveform. By incorporating both self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, the hybrid attention mechanism can potentially lead to more accurate alignments and better conditioned generative models.\n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions that the alignment predictor in EFTS2 is a variational alignment predictor, which suggests that it uses a probabilistic approach to predict the alignment. The hybrid attention mechanism may help to improve the accuracy of this predictor by providing a more nuanced understanding of the input data and its relationships with the latent representation.\n\nHowever, without further information or clarification from the authors, I must emphasize that my answer is speculative and based on my interpretation of the paper's content.",

The paper doesn't provide details on this aspect. However, I can say that the hybrid attention mechanism is likely designed to optimize the alignment between audio and text data by jointly considering multiple aspects of the input sequences, potentially leading to better performance than traditional soft-attention mechanisms used in previous TTS models.",
                "2.1BACKGRO": "Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to the specific details of the hybrid attention mechanism in the EFTS system as presented in your message. However, based on my general understanding of attention mechanisms and the context provided by the paper, I can attempt to provide some insights.\n\nThe hybrid attention mechanism appears to be a combination of two different approaches: a scaled dot-product attention mechanism and a non-parametric differentiable transformation. The scaled dot-product attention mechanism is used during training to compute the alignment matrix \u03b1 between the input text sequence and the output mel-spectrogram. However, this approach becomes intractable during inference due to the unavailability of the mel-encoder's output.\n\nThe hybrid attention mechanism introduces a new component that uses an alignment vector \u03c0 to reconstruct the attention matrix \u03b1. This is achieved through a series of non-parametric differentiable transformations, including the alignment vector \u03c0, which is defined as the sum of the input index weighted by \u03b1. The alignment vector \u03c0 is then used to compute a re-sampled alignment vector e, which is used to derive the reconstructed attention matrix \u03b1\u2032.\n\nThe contribution of the hybrid attention mechanism to improving the performance of the differentiable aligner in EFTS is likely related to its ability to address the intractability issue during inference. By introducing an intermediate representation (the alignment vector \u03c0) and using it to compute a re-sampled alignment vector e, the system can generate \u03b1\u2032 in a tractable manner.\n\nThis approach may improve performance by:\n\n1. Allowing for more accurate alignment: The use of the alignment vector \u03c0 and the re-sampling process may help to better capture the complex relationships between the input text sequence and the output mel-spectrogram.\n2. Reducing computational complexity: By avoiding the need to compute the attention matrix \u03b1 directly from the mel-encoder's output, the system can reduce its computational requirements during inference.\n3. Improving robustness: The hybrid attention mechanism may help to improve the system's robustness by reducing its sensitivity to the unavailability of certain input information (e.g., the mel-encoder's output).\n\nHowever, without more specific details about the experimental results and analysis, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation of how the hybrid attention mechanism contributes to improving performance.",

In the context of the differentiable aligner in EFTS, this mechanism might enhance the model's ability to capture temporal relationships and alignments between input hidden states, leading to improved performance.\n\nIf more information about the specific paper or its components is provided, I may be able to offer a more detailed answer.",

This allows for more informative and nuanced attention allocation, taking into account not only the expected aligned positions of each token but also its actual boundaries.\n\nThe introduction of two attention matrices, \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2), enables the model to consider both the central position of the token and its boundary positions when computing the attention weights. The Attention to Boundaries (A2B) transformation maps the attention matrix \u03b1 to boundary pairs (a, b), which are then used to compute the reconstructed attention matrix \u03b1(2). This approach helps to capture the local structure of the input tokens and their corresponding boundaries, leading to improved performance in terms of alignment accuracy and overall model output quality.\n\nIn particular, the hybrid attention mechanism improves the performance of the differentiable aligner in EFTS by:\n\n1.

Enabling the model to capture the local structure of input tokens and their corresponding boundaries, leading to improved attention allocation and resulting output quality.\n3.

However, this prior distribution is typically learned from the training data and not necessarily aligned with the desired distribution.\n\nIn contrast, EFTS2 proposes a hybrid attention mechanism and a variational alignment predictor to learn an expressive latent time-aligned representation.

The KL divergence term is then used to regularize this alignment prediction, ensuring that the predicted alignment is close to the true alignment. This allows EFTS2 to learn a more controllable and diverse set of speech rhythms.\n\nIn summary, while previous TTS models use KL divergence for regularization on the latent space, EFTS2 uses it for regularization on the alignment between the input text sequence and the generated waveform, allowing for more expressive and controllable speech generation.",

A high-level representation that captures general semantic information and is shared across all speakers (i.e., speaker-agnostic).\n2. A low-level representation that encodes speaker-specific information and controls various aspects of speech production, such as speaker identity.\n\nThe VAE-based generator then learns to map these two representations to the waveform space in a hierarchical manner. The high-level representation serves as a guiding principle for generating waveforms with diverse but coherent content, while the low-level representation refines the waveform generation process to capture fine-grained details that are speaker-specific.\n\nBy disentangling speaker identity from textual information at multiple levels of abstraction, this approach enables more expressive and controllable speech synthesis. This is particularly beneficial for voice conversion tasks, where a speaker's distinctive features need to be preserved while adapting to new text inputs.\n\nThe benefits of this hierarchical-VAE-based framework for voice conversion tasks include:\n\n* Improved speaker differentiation: By learning distinct low-level representations for each speaker, the model can better capture unique characteristics and preserve speaker identity during conversions.\n* Increased controllability: The high-level representation serves as a guiding principle for waveform generation, allowing for more flexible control over various aspects of speech production, such as prosody, tone, and articulation.\n* Enhanced expressiveness: By learning hierarchical representations that encode both general semantic information and speaker-specific details, the model can generate more diverse and coherent waveforms that better capture the nuances of human communication.\n\nOverall, this approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between textual inputs, speaker identity, and speech production, enabling more natural-sounding voice conversions with improved speaker differentiation and controllability.",

This is typically done using an autoencoder architecture.\n2. **Speaker embedding**: A separate speaker embedding layer would then process the speaker identity information to learn a speaker-specific representation. This could be a fixed-size vector or a continuous representation learned through an autoencoder.\n3. **Text-speaker fusion**: The output of the text encoder and the speaker embedding layer are fused together using various techniques such as concatenation, attention mechanisms, or fully connected layers.

The former part of the generator captures the text-dependent information, while the latter part captures the text-independent speaker identity.\n\nThe use of separate latent spaces for text-dependent (`z1`) and text-independent (`z2`) representations allows for disentanglement between these two types of information.

Here's how it works:\n\nIn traditional VAEs, the entire input data (e.g., text and speech) is learned to be represented by a single latent space. However, this approach can make it difficult to separate the effects of different factors on the output data.\n\nThe hierarchical-VAE-based framework addresses this issue by introducing multiple levels of representations. The top-level representation captures the overall style or distribution of the input data (e.g., speaker identity), while lower-level representations capture more detailed features (e.g., phonetic or lexical information).\n\nIn the context of voice conversion, the hierarchical-VAE can be used to learn a separate latent space for speaker identity and another for textual information. By doing so, it allows the model to disentangle these two factors and represent them independently.\n\nThe benefits of this approach for voice conversion tasks include:\n\n1. **Improved speaker identification**: By separating speaker identity from textual information, the hierarchical-VAE can learn to recognize and reproduce different speaking styles more accurately.\n2. **Better text understanding**: The lower-level representation can capture detailed phonetic or lexical information, allowing the model to better understand the meaning of the input text.\n3. **Increased controllability**: By having separate representations for speaker identity and textual information, it becomes easier to control and manipulate these factors individually during voice conversion.\n4. **Reduced mode collapse**: The hierarchical-VAE can help reduce mode collapse, a phenomenon where the model converges to a single output solution, by allowing the learned representations to capture more diverse and nuanced aspects of the input data.\n\nOverall, the hierarchical-VAE-based framework provides a powerful approach for disentangling speaker identity from textual information in voice conversion tasks, enabling more accurate and controllable voice synthesis.",

They consist of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder maps input data to a latent space, and the decoder generates new data samples from this latent space.\n\nIn the context of voice conversion tasks, VAEs can be used to disentangle speaker identity from textual information by learning a shared representation that captures both the content (textual information) and the structure (speaker identity). The idea is that the encoder maps input text to a shared latent space, where the speaker-specific information is encoded separately from the text-specific information.\n\nThe hierarchical VAE framework mentioned in your system message likely involves a multi-level representation learning approach, where the encoder decomposes the input data into multiple levels of abstraction.

                "1INTRODUCT": "Yes, I can elaborate. The hierarchical-VAE structure in EFTS2 is a key component that contributes to its improved performance over the original EFTS-CNN model.\n\nIn traditional VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), the encoder and decoder are typically stacked on top of each other, where the encoder maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space and the decoder maps the latent space back to the original input data. This simple architecture can be limiting because it often results in:\n\n1. **Limited expressiveness**: The VAE's ability to capture complex dependencies between variables is reduced due to the hierarchical structure.\n2. **Inability to model long-range dependencies**: The traditional VAE architecture makes it difficult for the model to learn and preserve long-range dependencies in the data.\n\nTo address these limitations, EFTS2 introduces a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator:\n\n1. **First layer ( encoder ):** This layer takes the input text sequence and outputs a lower-dimensional latent representation.\n2. **Second layer ( decoder ):** This layer generates the waveform output from the higher-level, more abstract latent space.\n\nThe hierarchical structure in EFTS2 allows for several benefits:\n\n*   **Improved expressiveness**: By separating the encoder and decoder into two distinct layers, EFTS2 can capture complex dependencies between variables more effectively.\n*   **Better handling of long-range dependencies**: The additional layer provides a way to model and preserve longer-range dependencies in the data.\n\nIn particular, the hierarchical-VAE structure enables EFTS2 to:\n\n1.  Learn more nuanced and varied representations of speech patterns, allowing for better control over the generated speech.\n2.  Produce high-quality outputs with more realistic rhythms and intonation.\n3.  Achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art models like YourTTS in voice conversion tasks.\n\nOverall, the hierarchical-VAE structure in EFTS2 provides a significant improvement over traditional VAEs by enabling the model to capture complex dependencies and preserve long-range dependencies in the data, ultimately resulting in more realistic and diverse speech synthesis.",

In contrast, 2-stage EFTS-CNN uses a single-layer VAE.\n\nIn a single-layer VAE, the prior and posterior distributions are formulated as:\n\np\u03b8(z|xalign) = p\u03b8(z1|xalign)p\u03b8(z2|z1), \nq\u03d5(z|y) = q\u03d5(z1|ylin)q\u03d5(z2|ylin)\n\nHowever, in EFTS2, the hierarchical-VAE structure introduces an additional layer of abstraction. The posterior network produces two latent Gaussian posterior distributions: q\u03d5(z1|ylin) and q\u03d5(z2|ylin). The first one is used to sample the intermediate variable z1 from which another latent Gaussian prior distribution p\u03b8(z1|xalign) is sampled.

The KL divergence between the prior and posterior distributions can be computed in two steps, which makes it easier to optimize.\n\nIn contrast, 2-stage EFTS-CNN likely uses a single-layer VAE where the prior and posterior distributions are computed simultaneously. This might make the training process more challenging due to the need to compute both the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence between the prior and posterior distributions in a single step.\n\nThe hierarchical-VAE structure in EFTS2 enables a more efficient training process by allowing for:\n\n1.

Datasets with longer audio segments (e.g., hours, days, or weeks) might provide more opportunities to learn these relationships.\n3. **Diverse speaker populations**: Speaker recognition benefits from datasets with diverse speakers, ages, genders, and accents, which can help models generalize across different populations.\n4. **Clean boundaries between speech and non-speech**: Datasets with clear transitions between speech and non-speech segments (e.g., music, silence, or other types of noise) would be helpful for training accurate speaker recognition models.\n5. **Variability in speaking styles and conditions**: Datasets that capture variations in speaking styles (e.g., fast vs. slow speech), emotions, and environmental conditions (e.g., noisy vs. quiet environments) can help model the complexities of human speech.\n6. **Large sample sizes**: Enormous datasets with a large number of samples would provide more opportunities for training robust models that generalize well to unseen data.\n\nWhile I don't have specific information about the characteristics of EFTS2, these features might be present in the dataset, making it suitable for speech synthesis and speaker recognition tasks."

This improved alignment results in better correspondence between the predicted and actual audio features (e.g., mel-spectrogram), leading to a decrease in the mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss.\n2. **Learning hierarchical latent representations**: The 2-layer hierarchical-VAE structure enables the generator to learn not only low-level, time-aligned representations but also high-level, hierarchical representations that capture context and relationships between different parts of the audio signal. These high-level representations can be used to generate more diverse and expressive speech patterns.\n\nThe decrease in KL loss is related to the improved alignment modeling.

The KL loss measures the difference between two probability distributions, so a smaller KL loss indicates that the predicted distribution is closer to the true distribution.\n\nThe decrease in mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss is due to the improved alignment modeling and hierarchical latent representation learning. With better alignment, the generator can more accurately reconstruct the mel-spectrogram features, leading to a smaller reconstruction loss. The hierarchical latent representations also enable the generator to learn a more accurate representation of the audio signal, which further reduces the reconstruction loss.\n\nOverall, the additional variational structure in the 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based waveform generator leads to improved alignment modeling and hierarchical latent representation learning, both of which result in decreased KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss.",
                "2METHOD": "The addition of a variational structure to the generator, specifically the 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based architecture, can lead to several benefits that contribute to the decrease in both the KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss. Here's a breakdown of the reasons:\n\n1. **KL loss:**\n   - In a traditional VAE, the KL divergence term encourages the mean of the latent space to be close to zero, as this represents the mode that matches the input data distribution. However, with an additional layer in the hierarchical structure (often referred to as a bottleneck layer), the latent representation becomes more compact and meaningful.\n   - This compactness is due to the fact that the bottleneck layer learns to capture only the most relevant features of the input data, reducing the dimensionality of the latent space. As a result, the KL loss term tends to decrease because it penalizes large variances in the latent space. The smaller latent space size means less \"spread\" or variance, hence fewer terms in the KL divergence formula.\n\n2. **Mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss:**\n   - A two-layer hierarchical-VAE-based generator consists of a feature extractor followed by an encoder (often a bottleneck layer) and then another feature extractor for the generator. The second part acts as a refinement layer that takes the output from the first feature extractor, passes it through the bottleneck layer to create a compact latent representation, and then uses this compact representation to generate new audio samples.\n   - This hierarchical structure allows for more efficient use of information and better adaptation to the input data. When the generator outputs mel-spectrograms, these are fed back into the same encoder (bottleneck layer) but now with more refined knowledge about what makes a good audio sample. The bottleneck layer captures not just general features but also those very specific characteristics necessary for generating realistic audio.\n   - As a result, the generator is able to generate mel-spectrograms that are closer to the target data distribution, thus reducing the reconstruction loss.\n\nIn summary, the additional variational structure in EFTS2 enhances both the KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss by enabling more efficient and refined learning processes. This leads to better performance in terms of both model efficiency (reduced KL loss) and generation quality (decreased reconstruction loss).",

The KL divergence loss is added to encourage the learned distribution to match the prior distribution. This loss can help the network learn more complex representations, but it may not always lead to better generalization or reconstruction performance.\n\nThe hierarchical-VAE-based generator you're referring to introduces an additional variational structure, which typically involves a 2-layer architecture: a lower-level encoder and an upper-level encoder. The lower-level encoder maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and the upper-level encoder takes this representation as input and produces the final output.\n\nThe mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss is likely added to encourage the network to generate realistic audio signals. By adding this loss term, the network is encouraged to produce outputs that are similar to the original mel-spectrograms.\n\nRegarding why both the KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss might decrease significantly with the additional variational structure:\n\n1. **Improved representation learning**: The hierarchical architecture may lead to better representation learning in the lower-level encoder, which can result in more informative and generalizable representations.\n2. **Ensemble effect**: The two-layer architecture might produce a more diverse set of outputs from each layer, leading to improved average performance on both the KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction tasks.\n3. **Reduced overfitting**: By adding an additional variational structure, the network may become less prone to overfitting to the training data, resulting in better generalization to unseen data.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about your system's architecture or implementation details, it is difficult to provide a definitive explanation for why both losses decrease significantly.",

However, without seeing the actual figure, I'll make some general observations.\n\nIf Figure 6 presents experimental results comparing different architectures or models for speech synthesis tasks, it's likely that the figure shows some level of performance metric (e.g., mean squared error, naturalness scores, etc.) across various configurations.\n\nAssuming the figure supports the idea that \"a more complex architecture is always better\" for speech synthesis tasks would require evidence that:\n\n1. More complex models outperform simpler ones consistently.\n2. The complexity of the model leads to significant improvements in performance (e.g., reduced error rates or increased naturalness scores).\n\nOn the other hand, if Figure 6 shows that some simpler architectures are competitive with or even outperform more complex ones, it would challenge the notion that a more complex architecture is always better.\n\nIf neither of these scenarios holds true, or if the figure presents mixed results, it may indicate that the complexity of an architecture depends on specific task requirements, dataset characteristics, or other factors.\n\nWithout seeing Figure 6, I can only provide general insights. If you could provide more context or details about the figure's content, I'd be happy to try and offer a more informed analysis.",
                "3.1TTSSPEE": "Based on the provided information, I can infer that the results in Figure 6 (not explicitly mentioned) likely show a comparison of different architectures, including EFTS2, VITS, and EFTS-CNN + HIFI-GAN. \n\nIf the results in Figure 6 support the idea that a more complex architecture is always better for speech synthesis tasks, it would suggest that EFTS2 outperforms both VITS and EFTS-CNN + HIFI-GAN, which could be seen as having simpler architectures compared to EFTS2. However, if the results in Figure 6 show that EFTS2 does not significantly outperform the other two models, or even underperforms them, it would challenge this idea.\n\nWithout access to the actual figure, I cannot provide a definitive answer.",
                "3.2MODELEF": "No answer. The text does not mention Figure 6 or provide information about its contents. It only discusses the performance and advantages of EFTS2 over baseline models, specifically highlighting its smaller model size and improved inference speed.",

                "3.4ANALYSI": "No answer. There is no mention of Figure 6 in the provided system message. The message only discusses the generator's hierarchical architecture and its ability to produce controllable diversity in latent variables, but it does not provide information about Figure 6 or its relationship to the complexity of architectures for speech synthesis tasks.",
                "4CONCLUSIO": "Based on the text, I can't determine how the results in Figure 6 specifically relate to the complexity of architectures for speech synthesis tasks. However, I can make an educated guess.\n\nSince the EFTS2 model has been shown to be a competitive TTS model that allows for high-quality speech generation with controllable diversity, and it adopts an adversarial training process, which is different from other architectures, it suggests that a more complex architecture (in this case, EFTS2's generator composed of a differentiable aligner and a hierarchical-VAE-based speech generator) can be effective for speech synthesis tasks. \n\nTherefore, the results in Figure 6 may support the idea that a more complex architecture is not always better, but it depends on the specific design and training process.",

Therefore, I cannot determine how the results in Figure 6 support or challenge the idea that a more complex architecture is always better for speech synthesis tasks.",
                "CANALYSISO": "The results in Figure 6 suggest that, in this specific case, a more complex architecture (a 2-layer hierarchical-VAE-based generator) may lead to improved performance (decreased KL loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss). This supports the idea that a more complex architecture can be beneficial for speech synthesis tasks.\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that the results do not universally prove that a more complex architecture is always better. There may be cases where simpler architectures perform equally well or even better than more complex ones. The effectiveness of a particular architecture depends on various factors, including the specific problem, dataset, and evaluation metrics used."
