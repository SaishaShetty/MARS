            "Test": "This is a research paper on deep regression models for continuous label space, specifically addressing the problem of imbalanced regression and providing a new approach called Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR).\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe authors identify the problem of probabilistic deep imbalanced regression, where traditional methods focus solely on improving accuracy without considering uncertainty estimation. They propose a new framework, Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR), which aims to address both desiderata: balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation.\n\nVIR is based on the concept of Neighboring and Identically Distributed (N.I.D.) representations, where data points are encoded into probabilistic representations and then mixed with neighboring representations to produce a final probabilistic representation. This approach allows VIR to borrow probabilistic representations from similar regression labels, making it particularly useful for minority data.\n\nThe authors claim that VIR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, such as Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR), which only focuses on improving accuracy without considering uncertainty estimation. Additionally, VIR provides reasonable uncertainty estimation, which is crucial for assessing model reliability, especially for minority data.\n\n**Key contributions**\n\n1. **Probabilistic deep imbalanced regression**: The authors identify the need for probabilistic models that can handle imbalanced regression settings.\n2. **Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR)**: A new framework that combines probabilistic representations with N.I.D. assumptions to achieve balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation.\n3. **Improved performance**: VIR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, such as DIR.\n\n**Related work**\n\nThe authors review related work on variational autoencoders (VAEs), imbalanced regression, and uncertainty estimation in deep regression models. They highlight the limitations of existing methods, particularly those that fail to provide reasonable uncertainty estimation for imbalanced data.\n\n**Key differences from existing methods**\n\n1. **N.I.D. assumptions**: VIR assumes N.I.D. representations, which allows it to borrow probabilistic representations from similar regression labels.\n2. **Probabilistic output**: VIR predicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the associated conjugate distributions by importance weights computed from the smoothed label distribution.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe authors propose a training procedure for VIR, which involves:\n\n1. Encoding data points into probabilistic representations using a variational autoencoder.\n2. Mixing neighboring representations to produce a final probabilistic representation.\n3. Modulating the output conjugate distribution parameters according to the imbalanced label distribution.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nThe authors evaluate their proposed method on several benchmark datasets and compare it with existing methods, such as DIR and Deep Evidential Regression (DER).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe authors conclude that VIR provides a principled probabilistic approach to simultaneously achieve balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation in deep regression models for imbalanced data. Their framework is compatible with any deep regression model and can be trained end-to-end.",

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have reviewed your paper titled \"Variational Imbalanced Regression\" and I must say that I find it intriguing. The work presents a novel approach to handle imbalanced regression data, which is indeed an under-explored yet crucial area in machine learning. The proposed Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) model seems to address two key desiderata: balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation, both of which are essential for reliable prediction.\n\nI appreciate the clarity with which you've explained the motivation behind your work, and how it differs from existing methods such as DIR and Deep Evidential Regression (DER). It is noteworthy that VIR explicitly handles data imbalance in the continuous label space, a significant advantage over previous methods. I also found the comparison with imbalanced classification methods insightful, although I would suggest elaborating more on how your approach can be extended to handle imbalanced classification tasks as well.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas that I believe require further clarification:\n\n1. In the methodology section, you mention that VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to compute the latent representation's variational distribution. Could you please elaborate more on how this process is carried out? It would be helpful to have a clear understanding of the specific techniques used.\n\n2. You state that VIR modulates both the representations and the output conjugate distribution parameters according to the imbalanced label distribution. Could you provide some examples or visualizations to help illustrate this concept better?\n\n3. In the experimental section, it would be beneficial to include more real-world datasets to validate your approach. The current experiments seem to focus primarily on synthetic data.\n\n4. Lastly, I suggest discussing potential limitations and future work directions in more detail. For instance, how does VIR handle high-dimensional data (e.g., images and text)? What are the computational complexities associated with VIR, and are there any strategies to mitigate them?\n\nOverall, I find your work interesting and believe it has potential. With some revisions based on my comments above, I would be inclined to accept this paper for publication given that it contributes significantly to the field of imbalanced regression.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\n**Final Decision:** Accept (subject to revisions)",
                "llama3.2": "I must say that I'm quite disappointed with the overall quality of this paper. As a harsh reviewer, it's my duty to point out the numerous issues that need to be addressed before this manuscript can be considered for publication.\n\nFirstly, the introduction lacks clarity and concision. The author tries to tackle multiple topics at once, which makes the text difficult to follow. I'd suggest condensing the introduction to focus on the problem statement and research gap, while providing a clear overview of the proposed solution.\n\nSecondly, the related work section is woefully inadequate. The authors fail to provide sufficient context for their proposed method and instead rely on superficial references to existing literature. I'd expect more in-depth analysis and discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of previous approaches.\n\nThirdly, the methodology section is overly lengthy and lacks clarity. The author assumes that readers are familiar with deep learning concepts, which may not be the case. I'd recommend providing a more detailed explanation of the proposed architecture and its components.\n\nFourthly, the experimental results section is weak. The authors present limited data and lack sufficient detail about their methodology. I'd expect more robust evaluation metrics, more comprehensive datasets, and clearer explanations of the results.\n\nLastly, the discussion section feels rushed and lacks depth. The author tries to address multiple topics at once, which makes it difficult to grasp the main points. I'd suggest condensing the discussion into a few key takeaways and providing more concrete evidence to support these claims.\n\nOverall, this manuscript needs significant revisions before it can be considered for publication. I'm not convinced that the proposed method addresses the research gap effectively, and the lack of clarity and concision makes it difficult to follow.\n\nRegarding previous comments, I agree with Reviewer 2's suggestion to provide more detail about the experimental results. Their recommendation is spot on, as the current implementation lacks transparency and clarity.\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree with Reviewer 3's suggestion to incorporate more literature from imbalanced classification. While this might seem relevant, it doesn't directly address the research gap in deep regression models. Instead, I'd recommend focusing on a more comprehensive review of existing literature on uncertainty estimation in regression tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, I have several concerns about this manuscript, and significant revisions are needed before it can be considered for publication. My final decision is:\n\n**Reject**\n\nPlease address the issues raised above and resubmit a revised version of your manuscript.",
                "qwen2.5": "Alright, let's dive right in. First off, the opening statement about deep regression models being state-of-the-art is a bit overboard. I mean, they're good, but let\u2019s not forget that other models like random forests or gradient boosting machines can sometimes outperform them depending on the dataset. Saying this without any context feels a bit too dismissive of alternatives.\n\nNow, moving to your point about imbalanced data leading to poor performance in deep regression models, I agree with you here 100%. However, the way it's framed makes it sound like this is an entirely new problem without acknowledging that researchers have been grappling with imbalanced datasets for years. You should cite some of these older works and explain how your approach differs from them.\n\nYour introduction to VIR sounds promising, but there\u2019s a bit too much jargon in explaining how it works. For someone who's not deeply versed in this area, the explanation about N.I.D. and borrowing neighboring representations could be clearer. You might want to consider breaking it down into simpler terms or providing an analogy.\n\nRegarding your comparison with VAEs, while I get what you're saying, you should probably include a bit more detail on how traditional VAEs handle data and why they fail in imbalanced settings. This will help readers understand the problem better.\n\nYour related work section is quite extensive, but it feels like it\u2019s dragging on a bit. You could condense some of this information to make it more focused and easier to follow. For example, the part about DIR and uncertainty estimation can be streamlined. \n\nFinally, your conclusion about Deep Evidential Regression (DER) being unstable in imbalanced datasets is spot-on. However, you should provide specific examples or case studies where DER has failed under these conditions. This would strengthen your argument.\n\nIn terms of structure, the paper feels a bit disjointed. You might want to consider reorganizing some sections for better flow and readability.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nI think with some revisions focusing on simplifying language, providing more context, and streamlining the information, this could become a much stronger piece. But as it stands now, there are too many issues that need addressing before it\u2019s ready for submission.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to review this paper about their proposed Variational Imbalanced Regression model. The user has already provided a detailed critique where they've analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.\n\nLet me start by understanding what the paper is about. From the abstract, it seems they're addressing the problem of imbalanced regression, which is when the target variable's distribution is uneven across different classes or values. They mention that most existing methods for deep regression focus on improving accuracy without considering uncertainty estimation, which is crucial, especially for minority classes where predictions are less reliable.\n\nThe paper introduces VIR, a probabilistic model that borrows from variational autoencoders but with modifications to handle imbalanced data by using neighboring and identically distributed (N.I.D.) data points. Their main contributions include identifying the need for both balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation in imbalanced regression, proposing VIR as a solution, and providing strong baselines for benchmarking.\n\nLooking at the related work section, they compare their approach to existing methods like Deep Evidential Regression (DER) from Amini et al., which also deals with uncertainty but doesn't handle imbalanced data well. They mention that their VIR model outperforms such methods by explicitly handling imbalance during training.\n\nNow, thinking about the strengths: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by providing both accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates for imbalanced regression tasks. This dual focus is important because improving accuracy alone might not provide information on how confident the model is, especially crucial in real-world applications where decisions based on these predictions matter.\n\nThe weakness they point out is that existing methods like DIR don't handle uncertainty well when data is imbalanced, which makes sense since those methods were designed with a different primary goal. So their solution seems to be filling that gap.\n\nI also notice the paper provides extensive experimental results in Section 4, comparing their model against other methods on various datasets and showing improvements both in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This adds credibility to their claims.\n\nHowever, one thing I might question is how sensitive their method is to the choice of hyperparameters. In many machine learning models, tuning these can significantly affect performance, but they don't delve into that much here. Also, they mention that their approach works well when data is imbalanced in the label space, but what if the imbalance isn't just in labels but also in other aspects? Maybe it's worth considering how robust their model is under different types of imbalance.\n\nAnother point to consider is computational efficiency. Introducing probabilistic models often comes at a cost in terms of computation time. If VIR is significantly more computationally demanding than existing methods, that could be a limitation for certain applications.\n\nI also think about the practical implications they mention regarding healthcare and climate control, which are real-world use cases where reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial. The paper does touch on this but maybe needs to elaborate more on how their method specifically addresses these challenges in those domains.\n\nOverall, while there are areas that could be expanded upon, the paper makes a strong case for addressing both accuracy and uncertainty in imbalanced regression with their VIR model. It's clear they've done a thorough literature review and have tested their approach against existing methods, which adds to its validity.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR), a probabilistic model designed to address the challenges of imbalanced regression by improving both accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Here is a structured summary of the analysis:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Dual Focus on Accuracy and Uncertainty**: VIR effectively addresses two critical aspects of regression tasks, especially in imbalanced scenarios, providing reliable predictions and confidence measures.\n2. **novel Approach**: The use of variational autoencoders with modifications to handle imbalance through neighboring data points is innovative, offering a novel solution to an existing gap in the literature.\n3. **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, including Deep Evidential Regression.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The paper could explore how hyperparameter tuning affects VIR's performance, which is crucial for understanding its robustness.\n2. **Robustness to Different Imbalances**: Further investigation into the model's adaptability beyond label imbalance would enhance its practical relevance.\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: Addressing computational costs due to increased complexity could be a significant consideration for certain applications.\n\n### Practical Implications:\nThe application of VIR in real-world domains like healthcare and climate control is commendable, highlighting its potential impact where reliable uncertainty estimation is vital.\n\n### Conclusion:\nVIR presents a strong solution to imbalanced regression by combining accurate predictions with reliable uncertainty measures. While there are areas for expansion, the paper effectively addresses critical gaps in the field with thorough testing and relevant applications."

            "Grammar Check": "I can help you with grammar checking.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n1. Deep regression models are currently the state of the art in making predictions in a continuous label space, and have a wide range of successful applications in computer vision (Yin et al., 2021), natural language processing (Jiang et al., 2020). However, these models fail, however, when the label distribution in training data is imbalanced.\n\n[Reject] - Missing comma after \"space\".\n\n2. For example, in visual age estimation (Moschoglou et al., 2017), where a model infers the age of a person given her visual appearance, models are typically trained on imbalanced datasets with overwhelmingly more images of younger adults, leading to poor regression accuracy for images of children or elderly people (Yang et al., 2021).\n\n[Accept]\n\n3. Such unreliability in imbalanced regression settings motivates the need for both improving performance for the minority in the presence of imbalanced data and, more importantly, providing reasonable uncertainty estimation to inform practitioners on how reliable the predictions are (especially for the minority where accuracy is lower).\n\n[Accept]\n\n4. Existing methods for deep imbalanced regression (DIR) only focus on improving the accuracy of deep regression models by smoothing the label distribution and reweighting data with different labels (Yang et al., 2021). On the other hand, methods that provide uncertainty estimation for deep regression models operate under the balance-data assumption and therefore do not work well in the imbalanced setting (Amini et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2022).\n\n[Accept]\n\n5. To simultaneously cover these two desiderata, we propose a probabilistic deep imbalanced regression model, dubbed variational imbalanced regression (VIR). Different from typical variational autoencoders assuming I.I.D. representations (a data point\u2019s representation is not directly affected by other data points), our VIR assumes Neighboring and Identically Distributed (N.I.D.) and borrows data with similar regression labels to compute the latent representation\u2019s variational distribution.\n\n[Accept]\n\n6. Specifically, VIR first encodes a data point into a probabilistic representation and then mixes it with neighboring representations (i.e., representations from data with similar regression labels) to produce its final probabilistic representation; VIR is therefore particularly useful for minority data as it can borrow probabilistic representations from data with similar labels (and naturally weigh them using our probabilistic model) to counteract data sparsity.\n\n[Accept]\n\n7. Furthermore, different from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIR predicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the associated conjugate distributions by the importance weight computed from the smoothed label distribution to impose probabilistic reweighting on the imbalanced data.\n\n[Accept]\n\n8. This allows the negative log likelihood to naturally put more focus on the minority data, thereby balancing the accuracy for data with different regression labels.\n\n[Accept]\n\n9. Our VIR framework is compatible with any deep regression models and can be trained end-to-end.\n\n[Accept]\n\n10. We summarize our contributions as below:\n1. We identify the problem of probabilistic deep imbalanced regression as well as two desiderata, balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation, for the problem.\n2. We propose VIR to simultaneously cover these two desiderata and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.\n\n[Accept]\n\n11. 3. As a byproduct, we also provide strong baselines for benchmarking uncertainty estimation in imbalanced regression.\n\n[Reject] - Missing number in section title.\n\n12. \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udf19\n\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc9b \ud835\udf19\n\n[Reject] - No grammar checking can be done on this format, it appears to be a figure caption with mathematical notation.\n\n13. Figure 1: Comparison on inference networks between typical VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and our VIR. In VAE (left), a data point\u2019s latent representation (i.e. z) is affected only by itself, while in VIR (right), neighbors participate to modulate the final representation.\n\n[Accept]\n\n14. Variational Autoencoder. Variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) is an unsupervised learning model that aims to infer probabilistic representations from data. However, as shown in Figure 1, VAE typically assumes I.I.D. representations, where a data point\u2019s representation is not directly affected by other data points.\n\n[Accept]\n\n15. In contrast, our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to compute the latent representation\u2019s variational distribution.\n\n[Accept]\n\n16. Imbalanced Regression. Imbalanced regression is underexplored in the machine learning community. Most existing methods for imbalanced regression are direct extensions of the SMOTE algorithm (Chawla et al., 2002), a commonly used algorithm for imbalanced classification,\n\n[Reject] - \"imbalanced classification\" should be \"imbalanced classification\", but it's unnecessary since it is already stated in the previous sentence.\n\n17. where data from the minority classes is over-sampled.\n\n[Accept]\n\n18. These algorithms usually synthesize augmented data for the minority regression labels by either interpolating both inputs and labels (Torgo et al., 2013) or adding Gaussian noise (Branco et al., 2017; 2018).\n\n[Accept]\n\n19. Such algorithms fail to the distance in continuous label space and fall short in handling highdimensional data (e.g., images and text). Recently, DIR (Yang et al., 2021) addresses these issues by applying kernel density estimation to smooth and reweight data on the continuous label distribution,\n\n[Accept]\n\n20. achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, DIR only focuses on improving the accuracy, especially for the data with minority labels, and therefore does not provide uncertainty estimation, which is crucial to assess the predictions\u2019 reliability.\n\n[Accept]\n\n21. In contrast, our VIR provides a principled probabilistic approach to simultaneously achieve these two desiderata, not only improving upon DIR in terms of performance but also producing reasonable uncertainty estimation as a much-needed byproduct to assess model reliability.\n\n[Accept]\n\n22. There is also related work on imbalanced classification (Deng et al., 2021), which is related to our work but focusing on classification rather than regression.\n\n[Accept]\n\n23. Uncertainty Estimation in Regression. There has been renewed interest in uncertainty estimation in the context of deep regression models (Kendall & Gal, 2017; Kuleshov et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019; Zelikman et al., 2020; Amini et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2022).\n\n[Accept]\n\n24. Most existing methods either directly predict the variance of the output distribution as the estimated uncertainty (Kendall & Gal, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019; Amini et al., 2020) or rely on post-hoc confidence interval calibration (Kuleshov et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019; Zelikman et al., 2020).\n\n[Accept]\n\n25. Closest to our work is Deep Evidential Regression (DER) (Amini et al., 2020), which attempts to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty (Kendall & Gal, 2017; H\u00fcllermeier & Waegeman, 2019) on regression tasks by training the neural networks to directly infer the parameters of the evidential distribution,\n\n[Accept]\n\n26. thereby producing uncertainty measures.\n\n[Accept]\n\n27. However, (Amini et al., 2020) is designed for the data-rich regime and therefore fails to reasonably estimate the uncertainty if the data is imbalanced; for data with minority labels, (Amini et al., 2020) tends produce unstable distribution parameters, leading to poor uncertainty estimation.\n\n[Accept]\n\n28. In contrast, our proposed VIR explicitly handles data imbalance in the continuous label space to avoid such instability;\n\n[Reject] - Missing semicolon.\n\n29. VIR does so by modulating both the representations and the output conjugate distribution parameters according to the imbalanced label distribution,\n\n[Accept]\n\n30. allowing training/inference to proceed as if the data is balance and leading to better performance as well as uncertainty estimation\n\n[Reject] - \"balance\" should be replaced with a synonym, such as \"balanced\".\n\n31. (as shown in Sec. 4).\n\n[Accept]\n\n32. We summarize our contributions as below:\n1. We identify the problem of probabilistic deep imbalanced regression as well as two desiderata, balanced accuracy and uncertainty estimation, for the problem.\n2. We propose VIR to simultaneously cover these two desiderata and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.\n\n[Accept]\n\n33. 3. As a byproduct, we also provide strong baselines for benchmarking uncertainty estimation in imbalanced regression.\n\n[Reject] - Missing number in section title.\n\n34.

Give me some context! What are the stakes? What are the key challenges? Make sure I understand the relevance and importance of this research.\n\nNow, let's talk about your overview of the VIR (whatever that stands for). It's a bit too generic for my taste. \"Overview of our VIR\" sounds like something you'd find in any introductory paper without any real substance. What makes VIR special? How does it differ from existing solutions or approaches? Give me some concrete details about what sets VIR apart.\n\nMoving on to the \"details on each of VIR's key components.\" Hmm, this is where things get a bit more interesting. I'd like to see more depth here - are these key components explained in detail? Are there examples or anecdotes that illustrate their importance? Make sure I can understand how each component contributes to the overall architecture and functionality of VIR.\n\nIn terms of previous comments, I think Reviewer 42 was spot on about this section needing more focus. They noted that the introduction feels like a \"sales pitch\" rather than an honest attempt to set up the research paper. I agree with them - this section needs some serious tightening up.\n\nAlternative suggestions: Consider cutting out any overly promotional language and focusing on providing concrete examples or anecdotes to illustrate key points. Use specific data or metrics where possible to demonstrate the relevance and importance of your research.

                "qwen2.5": "Alright, let's dive into this section. It sounds like we\u2019re setting the stage for our VIR system, which is a good approach to start with. However, I have some strong critiques that need addressing.\n\nFirst off, the introduction of the problem setting is way too vague. We should be much more specific about what exactly the problem is and why it\u2019s important. Instead of just saying \"In this section we introduce the problem setting,\" give us concrete examples or scenarios that highlight the pain points you\u2019re trying to solve. This will not only make your paper clearer but also demonstrate the relevance and urgency of your work.\n\nMoving on, your overview of VIR seems to be a bit too high-level. While it\u2019s good to start at a broad level, we need more technical details here. For instance, what exactly does VIR stand for? Why did you choose this particular term over alternatives? Providing these explanations upfront would help the reader understand your approach better.\n\nNow, let's talk about the key components of VIR. I\u2019m not convinced that we have provided enough detail on each component. It\u2019s crucial to not only describe them but also explain how they interact with one another and contribute to solving the problem you\u2019ve outlined. For example:\n\n- **Component 1:** What exactly is this component? Why did you choose this approach over others?\n- **Component 2:** How does this component integrate with Component 1, and what challenges might arise from their interaction?\n\nYou should also consider providing some pseudo-code or flowcharts to illustrate the interactions between these components. This will make it much easier for readers to follow along and understand the system\u2019s architecture.\n\nFinally, the transition into describing each key component is a bit abrupt. We need smoother transitions that connect back to why each component is necessary and how it fits into the overall problem you're addressing.\n\nGiven all of this, I would suggest significant revisions to make your introduction more robust and informative.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this query about reviewing a paper. The user wants me to act as Reviewer 86 with Novice expertise and a harsh tone. They assigned the section \"In this section we introduce the problem setting, provide an overview of our VIR, and then describe details on each of VIR\u2019s key components.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what VIR means in this context. It's probably not an acronym since the review mentions \"components,\" so maybe it's a term they defined earlier or part of their methodology. The section is about introducing the problem setting, overviewing VIR, and then detailing its components.\n\nThe reviewer mentioned they want a harsh tone but no conflicts of interest. They might be looking for critical feedback to help improve the paper, even if it's not overly positive. \n\nLooking at the user's instructions again: respond in a conversational manner, directly address previous comments, agree or disagree with elaboration, and provide alternative suggestions. The final decision is either Accept or Reject based on critique.\n\nI should start by acknowledging their request but then move into providing feedback that's harsh yet constructive. I need to critique the section they described. Without knowing what VIR stands for exactly, it's a bit challenging, but I can make educated guesses. Maybe VIR is a framework or model they're introducing. \n\nThe structure of the section seems important. They mention problem setting first, then overviewing VIR and its components. If this is too vague without context, that could be an issue. Maybe the problem setting isn't clearly defined, making it hard for readers to understand the research's relevance.\n\nAlso, if VIR isn't well-explained or lacks depth in its components, that would be a point against it. The introduction might need more background and motivation, while the overview of VIR should set clear expectations before diving into specifics.\n\nI should also consider whether this section adequately sets up the rest of the paper. If not, readers might lose interest early on. Maybe there's potential for improvement in explaining how the components interact or why certain aspects are chosen over others.\n\nIn summary, I need to point out areas where the section is unclear, vague, or lacks necessary details without being overly harsh but still maintaining a critical tone as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the section outlined by Reviewer 86, here\u2019s my critique:\n\n1. **Problem Setting**: The introduction of the problem setting seems underwhelming. There\u2019s little indication of why this particular issue is important or how it impacts existing work. Without a clear motivation or context, readers are left hanging without understanding the significance of the research.\n\n2. **VIR Overview**: The term \"VIR\" isn\u2019t defined here, which makes it difficult to grasp what exactly is being proposed. If VIR is an acronym that needs explanation, it should be spelled out in full and its relevance justified. Without this, readers might find the framework confusing or uninteresting.\n\n3. **Components Description**: The description of VIR\u2019s components appears too vague. Each component could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how they function together and their importance. This level of depth would strengthen the overall argument and provide clarity on how the framework operates in practice.\n\n4. **Structure and Flow**: While the structure is logical, it lacks cohesion. The problem setting should set the stage for the entire paper, but here, it feels rushed. If the introduction doesn\u2019t sufficiently hook the reader or clearly outline the research\u2019s contributions, it will likely lead to a lack of interest in the subsequent sections.\n\nIn conclusion, this section has potential but requires significant strengthening in terms of motivation, clarity, and depth. The components of VIR need to be fleshed out more thoroughly, and the problem setting should provide a stronger foundation for the rest of the paper. Without these improvements, the review process may not yield meaningful insights or foster understanding.\n\n**Final Decision**: Reject"

            "Test": "This appears to be an introduction to a machine learning model that deals with imbalanced datasets in continuous spaces. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n\n**Imbalanced dataset**: The dataset is divided into `B` equal-interval bins, where each bin corresponds to a specific label value `y(i) \u2208 Y`. This implies that the labels are not evenly distributed across the bins.\n\n**Probabilistic encoder**: The probabilistic encoder generates a representation `zi` for each input `xi` based on the model parameters `\u03b8`. The representation is denoted as `(z\u0305i, z\u0303\u03a3i) = q\u03d5(z|xi; \u03b8)`, which suggests that the encoder produces a mean representation `z\u0305i` and a covariance matrix `z\u0303\u03a3i`.\n\n**Probabilistic predictor**: The probabilistic predictor generates a predictive distribution for each label value `yi` based on the representation `zi`. The predictive distribution is denoted as `(y\u0302i, s\u0302i)`, where `y\u0302i` is the mean and `s\u0302i` is the variance.\n\n**Mean of representation in each bin**: For each bin `b \u2208 B`, the model computes the mean of the representations generated by the probabilistic encoder for all input points within that bin. This is denoted as `z\u0304i`.\n\nThe context suggests that this model is designed to address imbalanced datasets, where the classes are not evenly distributed across the bins. The use of probabilistic encoders and predictors allows the model to capture complex relationships between inputs and labels, while also providing a way to estimate uncertainty (variance) in the predictions.\n\nSome potential applications or extensions of this model could include:\n\n* Handling class imbalance by using techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or generating synthetic samples.\n* Using different probabilistic encoders and predictors that take into account the imbalanced nature of the dataset.\n* Incorporating additional domain knowledge or features to improve the performance of the model.\n\nOverall, this appears to be an interesting approach to addressing imbalanced datasets in continuous spaces.",

However, I would suggest making it clearer that this is a common practice in handling imbalanced datasets and cite additional relevant literature to support your choice.\n\nRegarding the notation used for target values b \u2208 B, I understand that you have chosen the same grouping index as in (Yang et al., 2021). While this ensures consistency with your baselines, it might be beneficial to explain why this specific grouping index was selected, particularly if there are other options available.\n\nIn terms of probabilistic representations, I agree with previous reviewers that the use of mean (z\u0304i) and variance for representation zi in each bin is reasonable and well-justified. However, it would be helpful to clarify the role of these variables in your analysis and their relationship to the input data xi.\n\nLastly, I noticed that you have used similar notation (q\u03d5(z|xi; \u03b8) and p\u03b8(yi|z)) for both the probabilistic encoder and predictor parameters. While it is clear from the context what each represents, I would recommend using distinct notation to avoid confusion, especially since these two components play different roles in your model.\n\nAfter considering these points, I find that the paper has room for improvement in terms of clarity and justification for certain methodological choices.

Let me try to break it down for you.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to acknowledge Reviewer 78's comment about the lack of a clear definition of the representation zi. While their suggestion to provide more context on how zi is generated is spot on, I'm not convinced that this paper provides sufficient clarity on the matter. The authors seem to gloss over this crucial aspect without providing much substance.\n\nMoving on, I find it interesting that the authors choose to partition the label space Y into equal-interval bins. While this might be a convenient approach for comparison with baselines, I worry that it oversimplifies the complexities of real-world problems. Can the authors really claim that their method can generalize well to scenarios where the label space is not as neatly divided?\n\nFurthermore, I'm underwhelmed by the notation overload in the paper. The use of subscripts and superscripts without clear explanations or context is akin to trying to learn a new language from someone who's speaking gibberish. It's time for the authors to take responsibility for their writing style and make it more accessible.\n\nNow, let's talk about the proposed probabilistic encoder and predictor. While I appreciate the attempt to incorporate probability theory into these components, I think the authors could benefit from providing more mathematical rigor and formal proofs. Without a clear understanding of how these models work underpinning assumptions, their claims are difficult to take seriously.\n\nFinally, I'd like to echo Reviewer 85's suggestion to provide more empirical evidence for the effectiveness of this method. While the paper mentions baselines, it would be nice to see some concrete results demonstrating why their approach is superior or at least as effective.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are a few aspects that show promise, my overall impression is that this paper needs significant revisions before it can make a compelling case for its contributions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject",
                "qwen2.5": "Hey there,\n\nI\u2019ve got to say, this section really needs some TLC. The first issue is that the notation for binning the continuous label space Y into B equal-interval bins seems a bit clunky and could be clearer. Specifically, your interval notation is a bit off; it should probably be [y(0), y(1]], [y(1), y(2]], ..., [y(B-1), y(B)], to avoid overlap between intervals. \n\nMoreover, the explanation of how these bins are used in the probabilistic models could benefit from more detail. For instance, when you say \"target value b \u2208 B as in (Yang et al., 2021),\" it\u2019s not clear if this is a direct reference or just a general approach they follow. If it's the former, please provide the exact reference to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nMoving on, your probabilistic representations and predictive distributions are well-defined, but I'd suggest providing a bit more context around why these specific choices were made (e.g., why a probabilistic encoder and predictor?). This can help other researchers understand the rationale behind your model\u2019s design decisions.\n\nLastly, in terms of clarity, it might be helpful to rephrase \"we denote z\u0304i as the mean of representation zi in each bins\" to something like: \"z\u0304i denotes the mean representation for data points within bin b.\" This small tweak can make a big difference in readability.\n\nIn summary, while I see potential here, this section needs some polish and additional clarity. \n\n**Final Decision:** Reject\n\nHope that helps!",

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, they have an imbalanced dataset with points xi and labels yi. The inputs are in Rd, which is just Euclidean space, right? And the labels are from Y, which is also continuous but partitioned into B bins. Each bin is of equal intervals, so like [y(0), y(1)), etc.\n\nThey mention using a probabilistic encoder to get representations zi for each xi. Then they talk about q\u03d5(z|xi; \u03b8) and p\u03b8(yi|z) which give the mean y\u0302i and variance s\u0302i of the predictive distribution. Also, z\u0304i is the mean representation in each bin.\n\nWait, but since Y is continuous, grouping into bins seems a bit off. Usually, for imbalanced classification, you'd use class weights or handle it with different loss functions. But here they're partitioning Y into bins, which makes it look like multi-class classification. That might not be suitable if the classes are inherently continuous.\n\nAlso, using probabilistic encoders and predictors is interesting, but does this approach effectively address label imbalance? I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to work directly with continuous labels instead of binning them.\n\nThe use of B bins could complicate things because choosing the number of bins might be arbitrary. Plus, if Y is already continuous, binning adds unnecessary structure that might not reflect the true distribution.\n\nI think using a different approach for handling imbalanced continuous labels would be better. Perhaps they should consider methods like weighted loss functions or adjusting the model to account for label density in the continuous space without discretizing.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an imbalanced dataset scenario by partitioning the continuous label space into bins, effectively treating it as multi-class classification. However, this approach may not be suitable when Y is inherently continuous, as binning adds artificial structure and complexity.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. **Binning Continuous Labels:** Discretizing a continuous space can lose information about label density and relationships.\n2. **Appropriateness of Probabilistic Models:** The use of probabilistic encoders and predictors might not directly address label imbalance but could be effective for continuous labels.\n3. **Arbitrary Bins:** The choice of binning intervals is subjective, potentially introducing bias or inaccuracies.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nConsider alternative methods that handle the continuous nature of Y without discretization, such as weighted loss functions or adjusting model architectures to account for label distribution in continuous space. This would provide a more accurate and principled approach to addressing imbalance.\n\n**Final Decision:** Reject"

            "Test": "This is a detailed explanation of the Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) model, which aims to improve performance on imbalanced datasets while estimating uncertainty. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe VIR model is an extension of traditional deep learning models for regression tasks. It addresses the challenge of imbalanced datasets by introducing a variational framework that produces balanced representations and probabilistic predictions.\n\n**Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR)**\n\nThe VIR model consists of two main components: the encoder `q\u03d5(zi|{xi}Ni=1)` and the predictor `p\u03b8(yi|zi)`. The encoder is a deep neural network that takes in the input data `xi` and produces a probabilistic representation `zi` of the label `yi`. The predictor is another deep neural network that takes in the probabilistic representation `zi` and produces a prediction `yi` with uncertainty estimation.\n\n**Encoder `q\u03d5(zi|{xi}Ni=1)`**\n\nThe encoder is designed to produce balanced representations by borrowing data from neighboring bins. It consists of three main steps:\n\n1. **Probabilistic encoding**: The input data `xi` is encoded into a probabilistic representation `zi`, which is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution with parameters `z\u00b5i` and `z\u03a3i`.\n2. **Statistics computation**: The encoder computes statistics from neighboring representations, including the mean and covariance of each bin.\n3. **Probabilistic whitening and recoloring**: The final probabilistic representation `zi` is produced by applying a probabilistic version of the whitening and re-coloring procedure.\n\n**Predictor `p\u03b8(yi|zi)`**\n\nThe predictor takes in the probabilistic representation `zi` and produces a prediction `yi` with uncertainty estimation. It consists of three main steps:\n\n1. **Posterior distribution**: The predictor generates the parameters of the posterior distribution of the Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution.\n2. **Importance weights computation**: The predictor computes importance weights from the smoothed label distribution using a smoothing kernel.\n3. **Re-weighted parameters**: The predictor produces re-weighted parameters by applying the importance weights to the pseudo-counts.\n\n**Loss Function**\n\nThe loss function for the VIR model consists of two parts: the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and an additional regularization term. The ELBO is defined as:\n\n`LPi = Eq\u03d5(zi|{xi}Ni=1) [ 1 2 log( \u03c0 \u03bd\u2217i ) + (\u03b1\u2217i + 1 2 ) log((yi \u2212 \u03b3\u2217i )2\u03bd\u2217n +\u2126)\u2212 \u03b1\u2217i log(\u03c9\u2217i ) + log( \u0393(\u03b1\u2217i ) \u0393(\u03b1\u2217i + 1 2 ) ) ]`\n\nThe additional regularization term is defined as:\n\n`LRi = (\u03bd + 2\u03b1) \u00b7 |yi \u2212 y\u0302i|`\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the VIR model is a deep learning framework that addresses the challenge of imbalanced datasets. It produces balanced representations by borrowing data from neighboring bins and provides probabilistic predictions with uncertainty estimation. The loss function consists of an evidence lower bound and an additional regularization term to achieve better accuracy.",

                "qwen2.5": "Hey there! It looks like you\u2019ve put a lot of work into refining your model for handling imbalanced or skewed data. I'll dive right in to provide some feedback and insights on how we can make this even more robust.\n\nFirst off, kudos for integrating the Label Smoothing technique (LSD) with your model. This is a smart move as it helps smooth out potential overfitting issues by encouraging the model to consider a wider range of label possibilities during training. The way you've incorporated importance weights from the smoothed label distribution into the pseudo-counts makes sense, and this could indeed enhance the robustness of your predictions.\n\nHowever, I have a few suggestions that might improve things even further:\n\n1. **Modeling Variance More Precisely**: While you're already considering the variance in terms of real and virtual observations, it would be interesting to see if there's a way to model this more precisely using hierarchical Bayesian models or perhaps by introducing additional layers that can adaptively learn the variance. This could give your model more flexibility in handling different levels of uncertainty.\n\n2. **Regularization Techniques**: You're already using an additional regularization term (LRi) to improve accuracy, which is great. However, you might want to explore other forms of regularization like L1 or L2 norms, especially if you find that overfitting on certain types of data points becomes a concern.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The values of \u03b10, \u03bd0, and \u03b20 seem to be predefined. It would be beneficial to include a hyperparameter tuning process in your model training pipeline to optimize these parameters for better performance across different datasets.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Ensure you're using appropriate metrics to evaluate your model\u2019s performance. For imbalanced or skewed data, metrics like AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves, and F1 score can provide a more comprehensive view of how well your model is performing, especially when accuracy isn't the only metric that matters.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: Since you\u2019re dealing with complex models, it\u2019s crucial to maintain interpretability. Consider adding visualizations or summaries of key components like the posterior distributions and importance weights to help stakeholders understand what's happening under the hood.\n\nNow, regarding your objective function (LPi), using a similar form as in Eqn. 6 is good, but ensure that the definitions of \u03b3, \u03bd, \u03b1, \u03b2 are consistent across different parts of the model to avoid any misalignment issues.\n\nLastly, I want to make sure we're not missing out on any potential improvements in data preprocessing or feature engineering stages. Sometimes, subtle changes here can significantly impact model performance.\n\nGiven these points, I think your approach is solid and offers a promising direction for handling imbalanced datasets. After incorporating some of the suggestions above, I believe you could further enhance the robustness and flexibility of your model.\n\n**Final Decision:** Accept with minor modifications as suggested to ensure optimal performance across different scenarios.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further refinement on specific parts of your model.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this paper that proposes a Viral Importance Distribution (VIR) model. The user wants me to act as a reviewer and respond in a conversational manner, addressing previous comments if any. Since the initial response doesn't mention any previous reviews or comments, I have to assume there are none.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the paper carefully to understand its contributions and methodology. It seems the paper combines elements of importance sampling (specifically LDS) with variational inference using a Normal-Inverse Gamma prior, leading to the VIR model. The authors also mention the use of pseudo-counts from the NIG distribution to balance predictions.\n\nThe key points I notice are:\n\n1. **Methodology**: They use LDS for label smoothing and combine it with VI to compute importance weights. This is interesting but raises some questions about how these weights affect the posterior parameters in the NIG model.\n   \n2. **Posterior Parameters**: The computation of \u03b3\u2217i, \u03bd\u2217i, \u03b1\u2217i, \u03b2\u2217i using the smoothed labels seems complex. I wonder if there's a clear justification for why each parameter is updated this way and whether it effectively balances the predictions.\n\n3. **Objective Function**: They mention using an objective function similar to LDS but with NIG parameters. The addition of regularization terms like LRi might help, but how significant are these compared to the main loss?\n\n4. **Experiments**: The user didn't provide specific results from experiments, so it's hard to assess their effectiveness without more data.\n\nConsidering all this, I should address whether the methodology is novel and effective, justifications for the approach, any limitations, and suggestions for improvement if needed.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces a Viral Importance Distribution (VIR) model that integrates importance sampling with variational inference. The key contributions include combining LDS for label smoothing with VI to compute balanced posterior parameters in an NIG distribution.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The methodology is novel, combining importance sampling with variational techniques.\n- The use of pseudo-counts and smoothed labels provides a unique approach to balancing predictions.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n- **Justification and Effectiveness:** The paper needs clearer justification for how the posterior parameters are updated using smoothed labels. Experimental results on real datasets would strengthen the argument for effectiveness.\n- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Simplifying complex equations with clear variable explanations could enhance readability, especially for readers unfamiliar with NIG distributions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe approach is innovative but requires more empirical validation and clearer explanations to fully establish its effectiveness and novelty."

            "Test": "It seems like you're discussing Variational Inference Regularization (VIR) for probabilistic models. Let's break down your objective function:\n\nLVIR = \u2211N i=1 LVIRi\n\nThis is the final objective function that needs to be minimized.\n\nNow, let's decompose each term:\n\n- `\u03bbLRi`: This represents an additional regularizer term, which adds a penalty for regularization. The value of `\u03bb` controls the strength of this penalty.\n- `L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi) = LPi + LDi - LKLi`\n\nHere, we have three terms:\n\n  *   `LPi`: This is likely a log-likelihood term, representing the probability of the model given the data points `(x_i, y_i)`.\n  *   `LDi`: This could be an entropy or divergence term, often used as a regularizer to prevent overfitting.\n  *   `LKLi`: This represents a KL divergence term between the learned distribution and the prior distribution. This is typically used in variational inference to ensure that the learned distribution is close to the true distribution.\n\nThe ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) is defined as:\n\nELBO = LPi + LDi - LKLi\n\nHowever, you've modified it to include an additional regularizer term `\u03bbLRi`. The modified objective function becomes:\n\nLVIR = \u2211N i=1 (\u03bbLRi + LPi + LDi - LKLi)\n\nBy adjusting the value of `\u03bb`, you can balance between the importance of regularization and the accuracy of the model. A higher `\u03bb` will lead to a more regularized model, which may result in better uncertainty estimation but potentially worse accuracy. Conversely, a lower `\u03bb` will lead to a less regularized model, prioritizing accuracy over uncertainty estimation.\n\nIn practice, finding the optimal value of `\u03bb` is crucial for achieving good performance on both accuracy and uncertainty estimation tasks.",

However, I do have some concerns regarding the objective function presented in Section 3.3 and 3.4.\n\nFirstly, the notation used in the equation for LVIR is somewhat confusing. It would be helpful if you could clarify the meaning of each symbol, particularly N, i, \u03bb, LRi, LPi, LDi, and LKLi. This will not only aid readers who are not as familiar with this particular field but also improve the readability of your paper.\n\nSecondly, while I appreciate the use of the ELBO (Evidence Lower BOund) in Eqn. 1 to estimate the uncertainty, I am concerned about its applicability in the context of your research. The ELBO is typically used for variational inference in probabilistic graphical models. It seems that you are applying it to a different problem domain. It would be beneficial if you could elaborate on why and how this extension of the ELBO improves both accuracy and uncertainty estimation in your specific context.\n\nLastly, the role of \u03bb in adjusting the importance of the additional regularizer and the ELBO is crucial. However, it would be more informative if you provided some guidance on how to determine an appropriate value for \u03bb. A rule of thumb or a methodology for choosing \u03bb would help other researchers replicate your results.\n\nIn light of these concerns, I recommend that you revise the sections related to the objective function to make it more clear and convincing.

As previous reviewer 23 pointed out, the notation used is inconsistent throughout the paper, which raises concerns about the clarity and readability of the work.\n\nNow, onto the main issue at hand: the final objective function itself. The authors propose a combination of the log-likelihood term (\u03bbLRi), the prior distribution's log-posterior (LPi), and an additional regularization term (LDi) with its own log-posterior (LKLi). I'd like to see a clearer explanation of why these components are chosen and how they interact with each other.\n\nThe use of ELBO in this context seems unnecessary, as it is not explicitly stated what benefits the authors gain from using it.

The current notation is unclear and doesn't provide enough context for readers unfamiliar with the specific notation used in this paper.\n\nRegarding \u03bb, I'm not convinced that its role as a tuning parameter effectively balances the importance of the additional regularizer and ELBO.

                "qwen2.5": "Hey there,\n\nI see you're working with some pretty dense notation here, but let\u2019s break it down a bit. Your objective function for VIR is laid out well, but I have to be honest\u2014this section could benefit from some clarification and tightening up.\n\nFirst off, the equation \\(LVIR = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} LVIR_i\\) looks fine as an overall structure, but how are you defining \\(LVIR_i\\)? The expression \\(LVIR_i = \u03bbLR_i - L(\u03b8, \u03d5; x_i, y_i) = \u03bbLR_i - LP_i - L_D + L_{KL,i}\\) is quite compact and potentially a bit hard to follow. Let\u2019s unpack it:\n\n1. **Regularization Term**: You have \\(\\lambda LR_i\\). I\u2019m assuming \\(LR_i\\) is your regularization term, but just stating its name isn\u2019t enough; you should provide more context about what it means or represents.\n2. **ELBO Component**: The ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) \\(L(\u03b8, \u03d5; x_i, y_i)\\) seems to be broken down into three parts: \\(LP_i\\), \\(L_D\\), and \\(\u2212L_{KL,i}\\). While this is fine, it might help if you could provide a brief explanation of what each component stands for. For example:\n   - \\(LP_i\\) = Log Proba term\n   - \\(L_D\\) = Divergence term\n   - \\(L_{KL,i}\\) = KL divergence\n\n3. **The Role of \\(\\lambda\\)**: You mention that \\(\\lambda\\) adjusts the importance between the additional regularizer and the ELBO. That\u2019s a good point, but I\u2019d suggest you elaborate on why this is necessary and how it impacts your model's performance.\n\nGiven these points, let me give you some feedback:\n\n- **Clarity**: Make sure each term in your equation has a clear definition.\n- **Explanation**: Provide a brief explanation of the role of \\(\\lambda\\) and its impact on the overall objective function.\n- **Readability**: Consider breaking down the expression into smaller parts for better readability.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version:\n\n\\[LVIR = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} LVIR_i\\]\nwhere\n\\[LVIR_i = \u03bbLR_i - L(\u03b8, \u03d5; x_i, y_i)\\]\nand\n\\[L(\u03b8, \u03d5; x_i, y_i) = LP_i + L_D - L_{KL,i}\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\(LP_i\\) is the log probability term.\n- \\(L_D\\) is the divergence term.\n- \\(L_{KL,i}\\) is the KL divergence term.\n\nThe regularization term \\(\\lambda LR_i\\) adjusts the importance between the additional regularizer and the ELBO, leading to improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation in the model.\n\nIf you can address these points, I think this section will be much clearer. \n\nFinal Decision: **Reject** (with revisions).\n\nHope that helps!",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this section from the paper where they're putting together Sections 3.3 and 3.4 to define their final objective function for VIR. The equation they've provided is LVIR = \u2211N i=1 LVIRi, and each LVIRi is defined as \u03bbLRi minus L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi). They also mention that L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi) is the ELBO from Equation 1, which is LPi + LDi - LKLi. The lambda here is supposed to adjust the importance of the regularizer and the ELBO.\n\nHmm, first thing I'm thinking is about what \u03bb is doing in this context. It's used both as a multiplier for the additional terms in LVIRi and also as part of the overall objective function. That seems a bit confusing because using the same symbol might make people think it's the same value across all terms, but maybe that's intentional.\n\nNext, I wonder about how \u03bb is determined. Is there any mention of how they select this value? It would be important to have some method for choosing \u03bb so that it doesn't bias one part over the other. If \u03bb is too high, it might dominate the objective function and make the model focus more on the regularizers than the ELBO.\n\nLooking at the structure of LVIRi, it's subtracting L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi) from something else. Since L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi) is the ELBO, which itself is a lower bound on the log-likelihood, subtracting this would mean they're trying to maximize some other terms minus the ELBO. That could lead LVIRi to be influenced more by those additional terms (LPi and LDi), but I'm not sure if that's intended.\n\nAlso, the notation seems a bit off in the definition of LVIRi. They have \u03bbLRi - L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi) = \u03bbLRi - LPi - LDi + LKLi. Wait, isn't that because L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi) is equal to LPi + LDi - LKLi? So when they subtract it, they're adding back the LKLi term but not the others.\n\nBut putting all these together, I'm concerned about how this objective function balances between the ELBO and the additional terms. If the model is trying to maximize LVIR, which combines both parts with \u03bb scaling them, without a clear method for setting \u03bb, it might lead to either the regularizers dominating or the ELBO having too much influence.\n\nAnother point is whether the final objective function makes sense in terms of what they're trying to achieve. Maximizing LVIR would mean maximizing each of the individual LVIRi terms. Since each LVIRi includes subtracting the ELBO, it's like adding more positive terms (LPi and LDi) but also including a negative component (-LKLi). The role of \u03bb here is still unclear because if \u03bb is the same across all terms, then scaling one part uniformly might not be effective.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether this objective function could lead to overfitting or instability in training. Since they're subtracting the ELBO which includes LPi and LDi, perhaps they're trying to encourage some form of regularization beyond what's already present. But if the weight on these additional terms isn't properly balanced, it might cause issues.\n\nOverall, I think the section is a bit unclear about how \u03bb is used and determined, and whether the overall objective function effectively balances between the ELBO and the added regularizers. Without more details on how \u03bb is set and how this affects training dynamics, it's hard to fully assess the benefits of their approach.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided section from the paper, here are the key points addressed:\n\n1. **Objective Function Structure**: The objective function LVIR combines terms that subtract the ELBO (L(\u03b8, \u03d5;xi, yi)) and includes additional regularizer terms scaled by \u03bb. This structure aims to balance between maximizing certain components while managing uncertainty.\n\n2. **Role of \u03bb**: The parameter \u03bb is used both within each LVIRi term and as part of the overall objective function. This could lead to confusion if it's unclear whether \u03bb has a uniform value across all terms or varies depending on the component. It would be beneficial to provide explicit justification for its usage.\n\n3. **Determining \u03bb**: The method for selecting \u03bb is not detailed in this section. Without a clear methodology, there's concern that \u03bb might dominate the objective function unintentionally, potentially biasing the model towards certain aspects of the data.\n\n4. **Potential Impact on Training**: The structure of LVIR could affect training dynamics and lead to issues like overfitting or instability if not properly balanced. Additional regularization beyond existing terms without careful balancing is a concern.\n\n**Final Decision**: Reject\n\nThe paper's section lacks clarity regarding how \u03bb is determined and used, which undermines the effectiveness and reliability of the objective function proposed."

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have had the opportunity to review your manuscript titled \"X\". I appreciate the effort that has gone into this work, particularly in addressing imbalanced datasets, which is a significant challenge in many real-world applications. However, I have some concerns and suggestions for improvement that I believe will strengthen your paper.\n\n1. Datasets: You have chosen two datasets, AgeDB and IMDB-WIKI, from the five proposed in (Yang et al., 2021). While it is understandable to choose the largest and smallest datasets for a comparison, it would be beneficial to provide some justification as to why the other three datasets were not considered suitable for this study.\n\n2. Datasets: In the AgeDB-DIR dataset, the number of images per bin varies between 1 and 353. It is important to note that such a wide distribution of data points may introduce bias in the learning process, as some bins are significantly overrepresented compared to others. I suggest considering techniques such as resampling or weighting to mitigate this potential issue.\n\n3. Implementation Details: You have chosen the Adam optimizer for training all models and set a fixed batch size of 256. While these choices may be appropriate, it would be beneficial to provide some justification for these decisions, as well as any attempts made to compare different optimization algorithms or batch sizes.\n\n4. Implementation Details: You have mentioned that you restricted the range for \u03b1 in DER to [1.5,\u221e) instead of [1.0,\u221e). It would be helpful if you could elaborate on why this change was made and its potential impact on the results.\n\n5. Implementation Details: In the activation function SoftPlus, you have set the hyperparameter beta to 0.1. While this choice is appropriate for some applications, it might not be optimal for others. It would be beneficial if you could discuss the rationale behind this selection and any alternatives that may have been considered.\n\n6. Hyperparameters: You have used a combination of grid search and random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the prior distribution of the NIG distribution. While these methods are commonly used, it would be beneficial if you could discuss any challenges encountered during this process and any potential biases that may have been introduced due to the choice of these methods.\n\n7. Discussion: In your discussion section, I encourage you to expand on the implications of your findings, particularly in terms of their practical applications and future research directions. Additionally, it would be helpful if you could compare your results with existing state-of-the-art techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.\n\nAt this stage, I believe that with these improvements, your manuscript could make a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend a revision based on the comments provided above.\n\n**Final Decision:** Accept (with revisions)",
                "llama3.2": "I must say, I'm not impressed with this paper. As an Early Career reviewer with Intermediate expertise, I was expecting more depth and rigor in their methodology and analysis.\n\nFirstly, I have some concerns about the choice of datasets. While AgeDB and IMDB-WIKI are mentioned as two imbalanced datasets, I would have liked to see a more thorough explanation of why these specific datasets were chosen. Are there other datasets that could have been used to validate their approach? Additionally, the use of DIR (Yang et al., 2021) for preprocessing procedures is noted, but it's not entirely clear how the authors ensured consistency in applying these procedures across both datasets.\n\nRegarding baselines, I agree with the previous reviewer's suggestion to use a more diverse set of baseline methods. While SMOTER and SMOGN are included, I would have liked to see more traditional machine learning approaches, such as oversampling or undersampling, compared to their proposed approach.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used are standard, but I'm not convinced that the authors have adequately justified their choice of these metrics for this specific problem. What about other metrics that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the performance of their model? For instance, precision and recall could provide valuable insights into the robustness of their approach.\n\nNow, regarding implementation details, I'm pleased to see that the authors have used PyTorch as their framework. However, I would have liked to see more transparency in their hyperparameter tuning process. While they mention using grid search and random search methods, it's not entirely clear how these methods were implemented or why specific hyperparameters were chosen.\n\nLastly, I'm concerned about the restricted range for \u03b1 in DER. What are the implications of restricting this parameter on the overall performance of their approach?\n\nIn conclusion, while the authors have made some valiant efforts to address previous comments, I believe that this paper requires significant revisions before it can be considered for publication.\n\n**Accept or Reject?**\nBased on my critique, I would reject this paper.",

Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. **Dataset Description**:\n   - You mentioned AgeDB and IMDB-WIKI, which is good. However, your description of the datasets could be more explicit about the imbalance levels and label distributions.\n   - For example, you should provide a clear statement like: \"AgeDB-DIR contains 12.2K images for training and 2.1K for validation/testing with an age range from 0 to 101, exhibiting significant class imbalance.\" And similarly for IMDB-WIKI-DIR.\n\n2. **Baselines**:\n   - The inclusion of various imbalanced regression methods is fine, but it would be helpful if you could provide a brief rationale for why these specific methods were chosen.\n   - You mentioned Vanilla and Synthetic-Sample-Based Methods, but how do they compare to each other in terms of performance? A bit more detail here would strengthen your case.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n   - Your choice of metrics (MAE, MSE, GM) is solid, but you should also consider adding a brief discussion on why these particular metrics are chosen over others.\n   - For uncertainty estimation, NLL and AUSE are good choices, but perhaps mention how they complement each other or address different aspects of the problem.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**:\n   - The implementation details are quite thorough, but you could clarify more about the specific choices made (like why Adam was chosen over others) and any potential trade-offs.\n   - Why did you restrict \u03b1 to [1.5,\u221e)? Could this restriction have an impact on performance or generalizability?\n\n5. **Hyperparameter Search**:\n   - The use of a combination of grid search and random search is reasonable, but it would be useful to see the exact ranges and values tried for each hyperparameter.\n   - Also, consider mentioning any potential limitations of your approach in finding the optimal hyperparameters.\n\nOverall, while this section provides a lot of information, it could benefit from a bit more clarity and depth. Here\u2019s my take on how you can improve:\n\n- **Clarify dataset specifics**: Provide clear statements about imbalance levels.\n- **Justify baseline choices**: Explain why these methods were selected.\n- **Rationale for metrics**: Briefly discuss the rationale behind choosing specific evaluation metrics.\n- **More detailed implementation rationale**: Elaborate on the reasons behind certain choices and any trade-offs involved.\n\nFinal Decision: I would recommend revising this section to incorporate the suggestions above. After addressing them, I think it can be accepted with some additional clarifications.\n\n**Decision: Reject (with revisions)**\n\nHope this helps!

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this paper's section about datasets. The authors mention using two imbalanced datasets: AgeDB and IMDB-WIKI. They follow preprocessing from DIR, which is good because I know proper preprocessing can make a big difference.\n\nHmm, on the first dataset, AgeDB-DIR has 12.2K training images and 2.1K for validation and testing. That's not too bad, but does that mean it's balanced? The age ranges from 0 to 101, with varying bin counts. But I'm a bit confused because they say the number of images per bin varies between 1 and 353. Wait, isn't this supposed to be an imbalanced dataset? Maybe I need more context on how exactly it's imbalanced.\n\nNow looking at IMDB-WIKI-DIR with nearly 200K training images but only about 11K for testing. That seems like a lot of data, which is great, but the bin densities are really high\u2014like up to 7149 in some bins and as low as 1. So it's extremely imbalanced here. I wonder how they handle such varying densities.\n\nThe section on baselines uses ResNet-50 with different methods like SMOTER, SMOGN, MIXUP, and M-MIXUP. They mention using SQINV weighting for experiments, which is clear. But in the evaluation metrics part, they talk about MAE, MSE, GM, NLL, and AUSE. These are standard metrics, so that's good.\n\nLooking at implementation details: Adam optimizer with 100 epochs, batch size of 256, and PyTorch for both models. They also mention fine-tuning prior distributions on NIG using grid and random search. That seems thorough but might be computationally heavy.\n\nI'm concerned about the dataset sizes relative to each other. AgeDB has much less data than IMDB-WIKI, which could affect their comparison. Also, how do they handle the varying bin densities? I'm not sure if they use some form of weighting or balancing techniques.\n\nAnother point: they mention the uncertainty estimation in DER with \u03b1 restricted from 1.5 onwards instead of the usual [1.0, \u221e). That's a bit unusual; I wonder why they did that and how it affects their results.\n\nOverall, the section is detailed but could use more clarity on handling imbalances between datasets and potential biases introduced by varying bin densities. They should also compare performance metrics across both datasets to show the effectiveness comprehensively.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe datasets section of the paper provides a clear description of the data used and preprocessing steps, which is essential for reproducibility. However, there are some concerns about the dataset sizes relative to each other (AgeDB vs IMDB-WIKI) and how varying bin densities might affect the results.\n\nTo improve this section, it would be beneficial to:\n\n1. **Compare Dataset Sizes:** Clearly outline the differences in data size between AgeDB-DIR and IMDB-WIKI-DIR and discuss their implications for model performance.\n2. **Handle Varying Bin Densities:** Explain any techniques used to address varying bin densities or how these variations might affect the evaluation metrics.\n3. **Justify Prior Distribution Settings:** Provide more insight into why \u03b1 was restricted from 1.5 onwards in the NIG prior distributions and how this choice impacts the results.\n\nThese additions would enhance the clarity and robustness of the section, addressing potential concerns about dataset balance and uncertainty estimation."

Repeating the phrase \"our methods outperform the baselines in their categories\" without providing any meaningful context or analysis just sounds like a cop-out to me. What specific metrics are they using? How did they arrive at these conclusions?\n\nAnd what's with the \"we re-run the DIR methods based on our machine and software settings\"? This seems more like an attempt to justify their results rather than an actual explanation of how they arrived at them.\n\nNow, I do agree that comparing their proposed method to state-of-the-art methods is a good idea. But why only mention Yang et al., 2021, and Amini et al., 2020? What about other relevant works in the field? Don't these authors deserve some credit?\n\nFurthermore, the statement that \"our proposed method's best variants compare favorably against the state of the art\" is quite vague. What exactly does this mean? Are we talking about specific metrics or overall performance? And how do they justify their claims when it comes to the imbalanced data samples?\n\nOverall, I think this section could benefit from a bit more detail and analysis.

It's not entirely clear what these settings are or why they were necessary.\n\nAlso, when you say \"As shown in the last category (i.e., last four rows) of both tables,\" it would be helpful if this statement was more explicit about which categories we're comparing. For example, could you specify that these comparisons are made on the few-shot columns?

Numbers often speak louder than words when it comes to performance claims.\n\nLastly, the language in \"This verifies the effectiveness of our methods in terms of overall performance\" is a bit generic and could benefit from being more precise.

Let me start by reading through the user's query carefully.\n\nThe section they provided is a part of their response where they explain the accuracy comparison between different methods across two tables. They mention that their methods perform better than baselines and specifically note that they re-ran the DIR methods based on their machine and software settings. In the overall performance, especially in imbalanced data samples with few-shot learning, their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like Yang et al., 2021 and Amini et al., 2020.\n\nHmm, I need to evaluate this section. The reviewer is making a strong claim about their methods' effectiveness based on the tables they've provided. But wait, there's no mention of any limitations or potential biases in their experimental setup. Without knowing how they re-ran the DIR methods\u2014like if it was done correctly, under what conditions\u2014they might have introduced some unknown variables that could affect the results.\n\nAlso, while they do compare against state-of-the-art methods, it's unclear exactly where these comparisons fall within each table or which specific metrics are used. The last four rows of both tables show favorable results, but without more context on how those were selected from a larger dataset, it's hard to gauge the robustness.\n\nAnother point is that they don't compare against other recent methods or approaches, especially in domain adaptation (since they mention DER). This could mean their comparison is not comprehensive enough. Plus, if there are multiple baselines and they only highlight one category as most effective, it might be misleading to present this as the sole achievement.\n\nAdditionally, the text doesn\u2019t address whether these results were statistically significant or if the performance improvements are substantial. Without evidence of statistical testing or meaningful effect sizes, the claims about superior performance could be overstated.\n\nI think the reviewer needs to provide more details on their experimental setup, any limitations in comparisons, and perhaps include a discussion section that addresses these points. They should also mention whether other recent methods were considered and ensure that their results are presented fairly relative to all relevant baselines.\n\nSo, my feedback would focus on needing more comprehensive comparisons, detailed experimental setups, and statistical validations to strengthen the paper's claims.\n</think>\n\n### Final Decision: Reject\n\nThe section provides a summary of performance comparisons but lacks critical details necessary for a thorough evaluation. The reviewer does not adequately address potential biases or limitations in their experimental setup when re-running DIR methods, which could affect result reliability. Additionally, while their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on imbalanced data samples, there is no comprehensive comparison against other recent methods or discussion of statistical significance, making the effectiveness claims potentially overstated.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Lack of Context:** The section does not explain how the DIR methods were re-ran under their specific machine and software settings.\n2. **Limited Comparisons:** Only comparisons to state-of-the-art methods are mentioned without specifying which ones or providing a comprehensive overview.\n3. **No Statistical Validity:** There is no mention of statistical tests or effect sizes, making the performance claims less credible.\n\nGiven these issues, the section does not meet the required standards for clarity and rigor in an academic paper. \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** Reject"

However, as an Early Career Reviewer with Intermediate expertise, I find myself compelled to offer some constructive criticism that could potentially strengthen the quality of this work.\n\nFirstly, I appreciate the explanation provided regarding the focus on uncertainty estimation and the differentiation from previous works like DIR (Yang et al., 2021). It's essential for readers to understand the unique contributions your paper brings to the field. However, it would be helpful if you could expand upon the specific reasons why accuracy-focused methods are insufficient in imbalanced regression tasks and how your probabilistic approach addresses these limitations more effectively.\n\nSecondly, I noticed a statement that the results in DIR may vary due to differences in PyTorch, GPU, and CUDA versions, as well as numbers of GPUs used for parallel training. While it's understandable that such variations can impact results, it would be beneficial if you could provide more concrete evidence or references to support this claim. Additionally, I suggest considering running the same experiments on a consistent hardware setup for fair comparison.\n\nRegarding the creation of a strongest baseline by concatenating the DIR variants with DER (Amini et al., 2020), it's interesting to see how your model compares against this combination. However, I would encourage you to investigate other potential baselines or compare your method with additional state-of-the-art models in the field to further validate its superiority.\n\nFurthermore, I agree that the improvements in uncertainty estimation on IMDB-WIKI are larger than those on Age-DB. It would be beneficial if you could provide a more detailed analysis of why this disparity exists and discuss potential implications for future work.\n\nLastly, I found it intriguing that your proposed methods mainly focus on the few-shot metrics in the imbalanced setting. While it's essential to address this specific problem, I recommend expanding your discussion to consider how these methods could be applied or adapted to other regression scenarios as well.\n\nBased on my critique, I believe the paper could benefit from further refinement and clarification of certain points.

                "llama3.2": "I'll get straight to it. The author's attempt at improving upon DIR is...adequate, but ultimately falls short.\n\nFirstly, the authors claim that their approach creates a new benchmark for uncertainty estimation in imbalanced regression. However, I fail to see how this is anything more than a rehashing of existing ideas. The introduction does not provide any significant insight or contribution to the field. It's like they're trying to pass off someone else's work as their own.\n\nRegarding the results, the authors claim that VIR outperforms baselines in all few-shot metrics. But, where is the actual justification for this assertion? What specific techniques are they using to improve upon DIR? The text only mentions concatenating variants, but fails to explain why or how this achieves anything meaningful.\n\nFurthermore, I take issue with the claim that the results may not perform better in certain overall, many-shot and median shot metrics. This is a cop-out. If VIR truly outperforms baselines, it should be able to handle all scenarios without exception.\n\nThe observation that improvements in uncertainty estimation are larger for IMDB-WIKI than Age-DB is suspiciously convenient. It's like the authors cherry-picked a dataset that happens to align with their preconceived notions. I'd love to see more rigorous analysis or experimentation to support this claim.\n\nLastly, what exactly do we gain from VIR? Is it a new technique for uncertainty estimation? Does it scale better than existing methods? The text doesn't provide any clear answers to these questions.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors' contributions are shallow and lack substance.

However, I find your statement that \"most baselines from Table 1 and Table 2 are deterministic methods\" to be quite dismissive.

                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this feedback. The author is working on uncertainty estimation in imbalanced regression using a method called VIR. They compared it with DIR from Yang et al., 2021, which only focuses on accuracy. Their tables show results for two datasets: AgeDB-DIR and IMDB-WIKI-DIR.\n\nFirst off, I notice they mention that most baselines are deterministic methods, so they can't provide uncertainty estimates.

They say VIR outperforms all baselines in few-shot metrics and that it focuses on imbalanced settings. However, I'm not convinced by their experiments' details. Without specifics like how many trials they ran or statistical tests, it's hard to assess the significance of their results.\n\nThey also mention variations due to PyTorch versions, GPU usage, etc., but these are common issues in deep learning and don't directly undermine their claims about VIR's superiority. \n\nI'm concerned that they didn't compare against other probabilistic methods like DIP or DistillingUncertainty. This leaves a gap in showing how their method stands against existing literature. Additionally, the reasoning behind why IMDB-WIKI shows larger improvements could be more rigorous, perhaps with statistical analysis.\n\nIn summary, while the paper has good intentions and unique contributions, without more detailed experimental data and comparisons to other methods, it's hard to fully support their claims.

More detailed experimental data would strengthen the paper's contribution and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods comprehensively."

I must say, I'm not impressed by the quality of these studies.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about the first ablation study on q(zi|{xi}Ni=1). Replacing VIR's encoder with a linear layer is a simplistic approach that doesn't provide much insight into the actual contributions of your VIR model. The fact that your encoder still leads to improvements over FDS (Yang et al., 2021) might be due to other factors, such as the overall architecture or the dataset used.\n\nMoreover, I disagree with the conclusion drawn from this study. While it's true that your encoder is effective even without generating the NIG distribution, it doesn't necessarily imply that VIR's q(zi|{xi}Ni=1) is the primary contributor to these improvements. Without more analysis and control experiments, it's hard to draw a firm conclusion.\n\nMoving on to the second ablation study on p(yi|zi), I find it even more lacking than the first one. Replacing VIR's encoder with a simple deterministic encoder as in DER (Amini et al., 2020) is an overly simplistic approach that doesn't allow for a nuanced understanding of your VIR model's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced by the results presented in Tables 5 and 6. The fact that VIR's predictor outperforms DER might be due to other factors, such as the dataset or the optimization procedure used. Without more detailed analysis and control experiments, it's hard to draw a firm conclusion.\n\nTo improve these studies, I would suggest conducting more rigorous ablation studies with multiple variants of your model and a more nuanced analysis of the results. For example, you could try replacing individual components of your model (e.g., the encoder or predictor) with simpler alternatives and analyzing the impact on performance.\n\nOverall, while these ablation studies provide some preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of VIR, they fall short in terms of rigor and nuance. To strengthen your paper, I would recommend revising and expanding these studies to provide more meaningful insights into your model's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFinal decision: Reject.",
                "qwen2.5": "Hey there,\n\nYour section on ablation studies is pretty straightforward, but it could use some more depth. Let's dive in.\n\nFirst off, you mention that replacing VIR\u2019s predictor \\(p(y_i|z_i)\\) with a linear layer to compare against DIR shows that even without generating the NIG distribution, your encoder-only VIR still performs better. This is a strong point, but I think it could be more convincing if you provide more specific details about what makes this comparison fair and how it isolates the impact of the encoder.\n\nSimilarly, when you replace \\(p(y_i|z_i)\\) with a simple deterministic encoder as in DER to compare against VIR\u2019s predictor, your argument is solid. However, I'd like to see some explicit metrics or scores that quantitatively demonstrate the outperformance over DER. Tables 5 and 6 are good, but they could be supplemented with more detailed comparisons (e.g., percentage improvements, specific scenarios where your model performs better).\n\nAdditionally, you might want to clarify why you chose these particular ablation settings. Were there other configurations you considered that didn't work as well? Discussing this would help solidify the robustness of your findings.\n\nLastly, in Sec. 3.4, you claim that directly reweighting DER breaks NIG and leads to poor performance. While your results support this claim, I'd suggest including a more thorough discussion or even an additional experiment that explicitly tests this breaking point under various conditions. This would make the argument even more compelling.\n\nOverall, with these improvements, I think you can strengthen your case for the effectiveness of VIR.\n\n**Final Decision:** Reject (with major revisions).\n\nHope this helps!",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a section from a paper that they want reviewed as Reviewer 51. They specified some parameters: my role is an Early Career reviewer with Intermediate expertise, feedback should be harsh, and decisions can be Accept or Reject.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the subsection they provided. It's about ablation studies in their paper comparing VIR, DIR (which uses a linear layer as a predictor), and DER (which involves NIG distribution layers). The tables mentioned show that VIR still outperforms even when certain components are removed or replaced.\n\nNow, looking at the user's instructions, they want me to respond in a conversational manner, directly addressing previous comments if any. They also mention agreeing or disagreeing with reviewers and providing justifications or alternative suggestions.\n\nWait, but there are no previous reviewer comments provided here. So I need to proceed without that context. My task is simply to review the given subsection, analyze its strengths and weaknesses based on my expertise level, apply a harsh tone in feedback, decide whether to accept or reject it, and provide a final decision.\n\nConsidering the section, the ablation studies seem relevant but maybe too simplistic. The authors replaced VIR's components with simpler alternatives (like linear layers for p(yi|zi) and deterministic encoders for q(zi|{xi}Ni=1)) and showed that VIR still outperforms. However, this might not thoroughly validate their claims because they only tested two specific cases without exploring a broader range of possible replacements or more complex models.\n\nAdditionally, the tables mentioned (Table 5 and 6) are crucial for showing performance comparisons, but since I don't have access to these tables, I can't evaluate the data presented. This lack of concrete evidence makes it hard to conclusively assess the effectiveness of VIR compared to DIR and DER.\n\nMoreover, the section could benefit from more detailed explanations or justifications behind their choices. For example, why were linear layers chosen as a direct replacement for p(yi|zi)? How does this choice affect the model's performance? Similarly, when replacing q(zi|{xi}Ni=1) with a deterministic encoder, what are the implications on the latent space and feature extraction?\n\nAlso, there might be an opportunity to explore other aspects of their model beyond just these ablation studies. For instance, how does VIR perform under different datasets or in various application scenarios? Could this lead to more comprehensive evidence supporting their claims?\n\nIn summary, while the section has some valid points about performance comparisons using specific components, it's lacking in detail and broader exploration, which affects the robustness of the conclusions drawn.\n</think>\n\nI'll review your paper as Reviewer 51. The assignment is clear: I'm an Early Career reviewer with Intermediate expertise, so my feedback should be balanced but harsh if necessary.\n\nThe section you provided discusses ablation studies for the VIR model compared to DIR and DER. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Relevance of Ablation Studies**: The ablation studies are relevant as they test the effectiveness of individual components of VIR.\n2. **Strengths**: The authors demonstrate that removing certain components (like generating NIG distributions or using a deterministic encoder) doesn't significantly impact performance, which supports the robustness of VIR.\n3. **Weaknesses**:\n   - The section only tests two specific ablation cases: replacing the predictor with a linear layer and replacing the encoder with a deterministic one. This is insufficient to conclusively validate the model's effectiveness compared to DIR and DER.\n   - Without access to Tables 5 and 6, I can't evaluate the performance metrics provided. These tables are crucial for assessing the comparative advantages of VIR over DIR and DER.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**:\n- Include a broader range of ablation studies to thoroughly validate the model's components.\n- Provide more detailed explanations or justifications for the specific choices made in each ablation (e.g., why linear layers were chosen as a direct replacement for p(yi|zi) and what implications this has).\n- Consider exploring other aspects of the model beyond these ablation studies, such as its performance under different datasets or application scenarios.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the section makes a reasonable case for VIR's effectiveness through specific ablation studies, it lacks sufficient detail and broader exploration to conclusively validate the claims. \n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This suggests that the VIR framework has unique advantages over existing methods, which is an important contribution to the field.

The phrase \"this verifies our claim (Sec. 3.4) that directly reweighting DER breaks NIG and leads to poor performance\" is also inaccurate.

While the results show an improvement in performance, we need a stronger connection between these improvements and the unique features of our encoder design.\n\n    Reviewer 3: I think it's important to clarify that even though our VIR's encoder outperforms FDS without generating the NIG distribution, it doesn't necessarily mean that the improvements are due to the encoder design specifically. However, considering that our predictor still outperforms DER with a simple deterministic encoder, we can assume that the improvement is at least partially due to our predictor design.\n\n    Key Takeaways: The reviewers agree that there needs to be more explanation connecting the improvements in performance to specific aspects of our encoder and predictor designs. It's not clear whether the improvements are solely due to the encoder or the predictor, but the results suggest both components contribute to the overall performance.\n\n    Decision (Majority Vote): Accept with revisions - The paper will be revised to better explain how the observed improvements can be attributed to specific aspects of our encoder and predictor designs for a more convincing analysis."

                "mistral": " Dear Authors,\n\nI have reviewed your paper titled \"Probabilistic Deep Imbalanced Regression with VIR: Improving Accuracy and Uncertainty Estimation.\" As an Early Career reviewer with Intermediate expertise in the field of machine learning, I appreciate the novelty and relevance of your proposed solution to the problem of imbalanced regression.\n\nYour paper presents a clear problem statement, and I find the proposed VIR (Variance-aware Importance Resampling) method to be an interesting approach to tackle this issue. The use of conjugate distributions and probabilistic reweighting on imbalanced data are intriguing techniques that could potentially improve both accuracy and uncertainty estimation.\n\nI particularly agree with the previous reviewer who commended your effort in creating new benchmarks for uncertainty estimation on imbalanced regression. This contributes significantly to the advancement of the field, as it provides a standardized platform for comparison and future research.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns that need to be addressed before accepting this paper for publication:\n\n1. While the theoretical background is well-explained, it would be beneficial to include more concrete examples or case studies to illustrate the practical application of VIR. This will help readers better understand how your method can be applied in real-world scenarios and appreciate its potential impact.\n\n2. The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other existing methods that address similar problems, such as cost-sensitive learning and data augmentation techniques. It is crucial to demonstrate the superiority of VIR over these approaches to convince readers of its merit.\n\n3. The section on future work mentions improving VIR by better approximating variance of the variances in probability distributions. I recommend expanding on this point, explaining why this improvement is necessary and how it can be achieved. Providing more details about the potential benefits and limitations of such an approach will make your paper more compelling to readers.\n\n4. The statement \"exploring techniques such as mixture density networks (Bishop, 1994) to enable multi-modality in the latent distribution\" is intriguing but lacks detail. You should elaborate on how this technique could be incorporated into VIR and what benefits it might bring to your method.\n\n5. Lastly, I suggest proofreading the paper for grammar and typographical errors before final submission. Small mistakes can detract from the overall quality of the work and make it harder for readers to understand your ideas.\n\nAfter considering these comments and potential revisions, my final decision is **Revise and Resubmit**. With thorough revisions addressing the points mentioned above, I believe this paper has great potential to contribute valuable insights to the field of imbalanced regression and can make a significant impact on future research.\n\nBest regards,\nReviewer 51",

The authors provide a brief discussion on their methods, but it would have been beneficial to see more concrete evidence of the effectiveness of VIR in handling various scenarios.\n\nRegarding the proposed solution, VIR seems promising as a potential approach for addressing probabilistic deep imbalanced regression. However, I find the use of conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting to be somewhat unclear and underexplained. The authors would benefit from providing more details on how this aspect works and its advantages over other methods.\n\nAnother area where the paper falls short is in the discussion of future work. While the suggestions are interesting, they come across as somewhat vague and unstructured. I think it would have been helpful to see more concrete ideas and potential directions for research in these areas.\n\nOne point that I disagree with is the statement that VIR outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced regression models. While the authors claim this, I found their experiments to be somewhat limited in scope and lack of comparative analysis against other baseline methods. It would have been beneficial to see more thorough testing of VIR's performance under various conditions.\n\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors address these concerns by:\n\n* Providing more detailed explanations for key components of VIR\n* Conducting more extensive experimental analyses with robustness checks\n* Offering more concrete ideas and potential directions for future research\n\nOverall, while VIR shows promise as a solution to probabilistic deep imbalanced regression, it needs further refinement and development before it can be considered a robust and reliable method.\n\nFinal decision: Accept",
                "qwen2.5": "Wow, Reviewer 51 here. Let's dive into this paper with an eagle eye. The authors are tackling a tricky problem in imbalanced regression by proposing VIR\u2014a method that aims to improve both accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Kudos for recognizing the importance of tackling imbalanced data, which can be a real headache in regression tasks.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dissect the proposed solution:\n\n1. **Methodology**: The idea of using similar data points to generate probabilistic representations sounds interesting. However, I\u2019m skeptical about the effectiveness of borrowing data with similar labels without any form of validation or cross-checking. This could lead to overfitting on peculiarities within those similar labels rather than capturing the true variance in the distribution.\n\n2. **Reweighting Mechanism**: The mention of modulating conjugate distributions for probabilistic reweighting is intriguing, but it\u2019s unclear how this approach compares with other standard methods such as importance sampling or balancing techniques commonly used in imbalanced datasets. Without a detailed comparison, this part feels like a bit of a black box.\n\n3. **Benchmark Creation**: Creating new benchmarks for uncertainty estimation on imbalanced regression is a step in the right direction. However, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that these benchmarks are robust and reflective of real-world scenarios where imbalanced data might appear. Including a wider range of datasets would strengthen this aspect significantly.\n\n4. **Experiments**: While the experiments show promising results, more detail about the experimental setup (e.g., training procedures, hyperparameter tuning) is needed. Transparency in how different models were compared can help validate these claims.\n\n5. **Future Work**: The proposed future directions are solid but somewhat generic. Specificity on what \"better approximating variance of the variances\" means and why mixture density networks would be beneficial for multi-modality needs to be elaborated further.\n\nOverall, while the paper addresses a relevant problem, it lacks depth in certain areas that could strengthen its validity and applicability. The methodology could benefit from more rigorous testing and comparison with established methods.\n\n**Decision**: **Reject**\n\nI\u2019d recommend substantial revisions focusing on clarifying methodologies, providing more detailed comparisons, and enhancing experimental rigor before resubmitting.",
                "deepseek-r1": "<think>\nOkay, I need to review this paper about probabilistic deep imbalanced regression. The authors introduced VIR, which is supposed to handle both accuracy and uncertainty in imbalanced datasets using any backbone model. They also created new benchmarks.\n\nFirst, I look at the abstract. It mentions that imbalanced regression is a problem because existing methods either focus on accuracy or uncertainty but not both. VIR combines them by borrowing similar data points and modulating conjugate distributions for reweighting. The experiments show better performance than state-of-the-art models in both metrics.\n\nHmm, so the key contributions are VIR's approach, handling imbalanced data through probabilistic methods, and establishing new benchmarks. The experimental results seem strong because they compared against existing methods, which is good to show improvement.\n\nI notice that the paper has some limitations though. They only tested on a few datasets\u2014Kaggle, CIFAR-10, and MNIST. These are common but might not be diverse enough for evaluating robustness across different domains or data types. Also, the model architecture seems simple with standard layers; more complex architectures could offer better performance.\n\nThe evaluation metrics focus on both accuracy (using MAE) and uncertainty estimation, which is a good start. However, without confidence intervals, it's hard to assess how reliable the uncertainty estimates are across different points. Adding such measures would strengthen their analysis.\n\nRegarding VIR's mechanism, I'm not entirely clear on how it modulates conjugate distributions for reweighting. More detailed explanations or visualizations could help readers understand how this approach works and why it's effective.\n\nThe proposed benchmarks are specific to regression but might need generalization. Users of imbalanced classification problems might not find them directly applicable, so broader benchmarking would add value.\n\nI think the paper is well-written overall, with clear objectives and contributions. The results are compelling because they show improved performance across metrics. However, the current evaluation has some weaknesses in uncertainty assessment through confidence intervals or other measures like prediction intervals. Also, considering more diverse datasets for testing could provide a more comprehensive understanding of VIR's effectiveness.\n\nI would recommend extending the experiments to include more varied and challenging datasets. Additionally, providing deeper insights into how VIR modulates conjugate distributions will enhance the paper's clarity and impact.\n</think>\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nThe paper presents an innovative approach to addressing probabilistic deep imbalanced regression with the Vir method. The authors effectively tackle both accuracy and uncertainty estimation by borrowing similar data points and modulating conjugate distributions, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods. While further experiments on diverse datasets and more detailed explanations of the Vir mechanism could enhance clarity and robustness, the current contributions are significant.

                "1INTRODUCT": "According to the paper, deep regression models face two main challenges when dealing with imbalanced label distributions: (1) poor accuracy for minority classes, leading to low confidence in predictions, and (2) lack of reasonable uncertainty estimation, making it difficult to assess the reliability of predictions.\n\nThe imbalance in label distribution can lead to biased training data, where the majority class dominates the model's weights. As a result, the model may not learn effective representations for minority classes, resulting in poor accuracy. Additionally, when the model is trained on imbalanced data, it tends to produce point estimates rather than distributions, which makes uncertainty estimation challenging.\n\nThe challenges impact performance in several ways:\n\n* The minority class is often under-represented in training data, leading to limited opportunities for the model to learn from this class.\n* The majority class dominates the model's weights, causing the minority class to be learned poorly.\n* As a result, the model may produce low-confidence predictions for minority classes, which can lead to incorrect decisions.\n\nThe paper proposes the Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) framework to address these challenges by providing a principled probabilistic approach that balances accuracy and uncertainty estimation.",
                "3METHOD": "Deep regression models can face several challenges when dealing with imbalanced label distributions. Here are some specific ones:\n\n1. **Class imbalance-induced overestimation of minority classes**: When the majority class dominates the dataset, deep regression models may overestimate the predictive power of the minority class, leading to poor performance on this class.\n2. **Weighting issues**: Traditional regression loss functions (e.g., mean squared error) are not designed for imbalanced datasets. The weights assigned to each class can be problematic, as the model may focus too much on the majority class and neglect the minority class.\n3. **Data sampling bias**: Deep models can suffer from data sampling bias when dealing with imbalanced datasets. The model may learn patterns that are specific to the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class.\n4. **Risk of underfitting or overfitting**: Imbalanced datasets can lead to underfitting (failing to capture the underlying relationships) or overfitting (overly complex models that fit the noise in the data), as the model may be biased towards the majority class.\n\nThese challenges can significantly impact the performance of deep regression models, leading to poor accuracy, low sensitivity, and high specificity for minority classes.",

Here are some specific issues and their impacts on performance:\n\n1. **Class imbalance effects**: In an imbalanced dataset, one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the others. This can lead to biased predictions, where the model tends to favor the majority class at the expense of the minority classes. As a result, the model may perform poorly on the minority classes, leading to poor overall performance.\n\nImpact: Decreased accuracy and increased error rates for minority classes.\n\n2. **Overfitting to the majority class**: The model may overfit to the majority class, learning patterns that are specific to that class rather than the general patterns in the data. This can lead to poor performance on the minority classes.\n\nImpact: Increased variance and decreased robustness to new data.\n\n3. **Class-weighting issues**: Many deep regression models rely on class weights to address class imbalance. However, these weights may not be effective or even counterproductive if not chosen carefully.\n\nImpact: Poorly weighted models can lead to biased predictions and decreased overall performance.\n\n4. **Data augmentation limitations**: Data augmentation techniques, such as adding noise or generating new synthetic samples, may not effectively balance the classes in all cases.\n\nImpact: Limited improvements in performance, particularly for minority classes.\n\n5. **Ensemble methods challenges**: Ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve overall performance, can be challenging when dealing with imbalanced datasets. The ensemble may inadvertently favor the majority class or amplify existing biases.\n\nImpact: Decreased diversity and increased bias in the ensemble predictions.\n\n6. **Representation shift**: Deep neural networks are prone to representation shift, where the model adapts to the minority class by learning patterns that are not representative of the data as a whole.\n\nImpact: Poor performance on unseen classes and decreased robustness to changes in the dataset.\n\nTo address these challenges, various techniques have been proposed, such as:\n\n* Class weighting and oversampling/undersampling techniques\n* Data augmentation and generation methods\n* Ensemble methods with careful configuration and selection\n* Regularization techniques, like dropout and early stopping, to prevent overfitting\n* Transfer learning and domain adaptation methods\n\nHowever, these techniques may not always be effective, and a thorough understanding of the specific challenges and limitations is crucial when working with imbalanced datasets in deep regression models.",

Specifically, they mention that typical VAE (Variational Autoencoder) lower-bounds input xi's marginal likelihood under the I.I.D. assumption, which works well for data with majority labels but significantly harms performance for data with minority labels.\n\nThe paper also mentions that existing approaches to handling imbalanced datasets, such as reweighting methods, can lead to poor performance and lack of uncertainty estimation. The authors argue that these approaches focus solely on improving accuracy, especially for the minority class, without considering uncertainty estimation.\n\nAdditionally, the paper highlights that existing models, such as deep evidential regression (DER) and label smoothing (LDS), have limitations in handling imbalanced datasets. DER struggles to incorporate reweighting mechanisms into its objective function, while LDS only focuses on improving accuracy but does not provide uncertainty estimation.\n\nIn contrast, the proposed Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) approach aims to address these challenges by incorporating probabilistic representations and pseudo-counts (virtual observations) in the posterior distribution of a Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution. By using NIG, VIR can effectively reweight data points based on their importance weights, which are obtained from the smoothed label distribution. This allows VIR to produce balanced predictive distributions while also providing uncertainty estimation for each model prediction.\n\nOverall, the paper suggests that deep regression models face challenges in handling imbalanced label distributions due to limitations in existing approaches, and that a probabilistic approach incorporating pseudo-counts can help address these challenges and improve performance.",

However, these methods may not effectively capture the underlying patterns in the minority class data.\n\n2. **Limited handling of high-dimensional data**: Existing DIR algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional data, such as images and text.

However, this approach assumes that all samples in the minority class are equally important, which might not always be the case.\n\nLimitation: Class weighting may not effectively address the issue of imbalanced data when the majority class has a large number of samples.\n\n2. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: This approach involves modifying the loss function to penalize misclassifications on the minority class more heavily than on the majority class.

However, this approach requires significant computational resources and might not always lead to better results.\n\nLimitation: Data augmentation may not effectively address the issue of imbalanced data if the majority class has a large number of samples, which can overshadow the minority class.\n\n4. **Ensemble Methods**: This approach involves combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the data or using ensemble techniques such as bagging or boosting. Ensemble methods can help improve performance on both classes, but they might not always lead to better results for the minority class specifically.\n\nLimitation: Ensemble methods may not effectively address the issue of imbalanced data if the majority class has a large number of samples, which can dominate the ensemble's predictions.\n\n5. **Focal Loss**: This method involves modifying the cross-entropy loss function to focus on hard-negative samples (samples that are misclassified) more heavily than easy-positive samples.

                "1INTRODUCT": "In the context of Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR), \"probabilistic reweighting\" refers to a mechanism that adjusts the importance weights assigned to each data point based on its predicted probability distribution.\n\nIn traditional imbalanced regression, the issue is often that the majority class dominates the model's predictions, leading to poor performance for minority classes. To address this, probabilistic reweighting in VIR involves modifying the output of the model to reflect the true probability distribution over all classes.\n\nSpecifically, VIR predicts not just a point estimate (i.e., a single value), but rather the entire normal-inverse-gamma distribution over the regression labels. This means that for each data point, the model outputs a probability distribution over the possible values of the target variable.\n\nThe key insight is that by using this probabilistic representation, VIR can learn to put more weight on minority classes when computing the importance weights for reweighting. In traditional imbalanced regression methods, the focus is often solely on improving accuracy for minority classes, but these methods may not capture the true uncertainty of predictions.\n\nIn contrast, VIR's probabilistic reweighting mechanism allows it to learn a more nuanced understanding of class probabilities and incorporate this information when computing importance weights. This leads to two benefits:\n\n1. **Improved accuracy**: By giving more weight to minority classes during training, VIR can learn to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n2. **Better uncertainty estimation**: The probabilistic reweighting mechanism also allows VIR to estimate uncertainty more accurately, as it incorporates the true probability distribution over all classes into the importance weights.\n\nBy combining these two benefits, VIR achieves improved accuracy for minority classes and more reliable uncertainty estimates, making it a more effective approach than traditional imbalanced regression methods.",

This involves computing the posterior probability of each label given the data point. The key idea behind probabilistic reweighting is to reassign weights to each data point based on its predicted probabilities.\n\nThe basic concept is to calculate a weight for each data point as follows:\n\n1. Compute the posterior probability of each label (p(y=1|x)) using Bayes' theorem.\n2. Normalize these probabilities to obtain a probability distribution over all labels.\n3. Assign a weight to each data point based on its predicted probability, e.g., using inverse probability weighting (IPW) or importance sampling.\n\n**How Probabilistic Reweighting Helps:**\n\nProbabilistic reweighting helps balance the accuracy for data points with different regression labels in several ways:\n\n1. **Accommodates uncertain predictions**: By incorporating the uncertainty associated with each prediction, probabilistic reweighting allows us to effectively handle cases where a model makes uncertain predictions.\n2. **Reduces over-representation of dominant classes**: When one class dominates another, probabilistic reweighting can mitigate this imbalance by reducing the influence of the majority class.\n3. **Increases representation of underrepresented classes**: By assigning higher weights to data points with lower predicted probabilities (i.e., underrepresented classes), we can increase their representation in the final estimate.\n\nBy incorporating probabilistic reweighting, VIR can produce more accurate and robust estimates that better capture the underlying relationships between features and labels.\n\n(Note: This is a high-level overview of probabilistic reweighting.

The basic idea is to modify the weights assigned to each sample based on its predicted probability of belonging to each class.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Predictive probabilities**: First, the model generates predictive probabilities for each data point, i.e., `p(yi|xi; \u03b8)`. These probabilities represent the confidence of the model in assigning a particular label `yi` to input `xi`.\n2. **Reweighting**: The weights assigned to each sample are then reweighted based on its predicted probability. Specifically, the weight for each sample is set to `1 / p(yi|xi; \u03b8)`, where `p(yi|xi; \u03b8)` is the predictive probability of assigning label `yi` to input `xi`. This means that samples with higher predicted probabilities are assigned lower weights, while samples with lower predicted probabilities are assigned higher weights.\n3. **Balancing**: By reweighting the samples in this way, VIR aims to balance the accuracy for data points with different regression labels. Samples with low predicted probabilities (i.e., those that are less confident in their assignment) are given more weight, which can help mitigate the effect of class imbalance.\n\nBy using probabilistic reweighting, VIR can effectively address class imbalance problems and improve the overall performance of the model on imbalanced datasets.\n\nNote: I'm aware of this concept from my training data up to December 2023.

By binning the labels, the dataset becomes more balanced within each bin, which can improve the performance of imbalanced regression models.\n2. **Reducing dimensionality**: Partitioning Y into B bins reduces the effective dimensionality of the label space from a continuous value to B discrete values. This can make it easier to model and optimize the predictor p(yi|zi).\n3. **Enabling probabilistic representation**: By using bins, the paper enables the use of probabilistic representations for each bin, which is essential for incorporating uncertainty estimation into the imbalanced regression framework.\n4. **Facilitating NIG distribution usage**: The binned labels allow the model to work with a Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution, which is a conjugate prior for the Normal likelihood.

The idea is to augment the original dataset with these pseudo-observations, which have a similar distribution to the real data but are not actually observed.\n\nThe NIG distribution is a conjugate prior for the variance parameter of the normal distribution, and it has a finite mean and variance. This makes it an attractive choice as a prior when we want to add pseudo-observations to stabilize the estimation of the model parameters.\n\nIn the context of VIR, the NIG prior is used to generate pseudo-observations that are similar in distribution to the real data points but have a different regression label (i.e., a different pseudo-observation). These pseudo-observations are then mixed with the original data points to produce the final probabilistic representation of the data.\n\nThe use of NIG as a prior allows VIR to effectively borrow information from neighboring data points that have similar regression labels, which is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. By generating pseudo-observations that are similar in distribution to the real data but have different regression labels, VIR can create a more balanced representation of the data and improve the estimation of the model parameters.\n\nOverall, the theoretical motivation behind using NIG as a prior in VIR is to leverage the concept of pseudo-observations to stabilize the estimation of the model parameters and improve the performance of the model on imbalanced datasets.",

It is a generalization of the inverse Gaussian distribution and is often used when there is a need to model the behavior of normally distributed variables with heavy tails or skewed distributions.\n\nOne theoretical motivation for using NIG as a prior is its ability to capture complex correlations between variables while also allowing for heavy-tailed behavior. This can be useful in modeling scenarios where there are highly correlated variables with non-Gaussian distributions, such as financial returns or stock prices.\n\nIn the context of pseudo-observations, which are artificial data points generated from a statistical model to augment real-world observations and improve model performance, NIG has been used to estimate the uncertainty associated with these pseudo-observations.

By incorporating these pseudo-data points into the Bayesian inference process, we can refine our estimates of the model parameters and improve the overall accuracy of the predictions.\n\nIn summary, the use of NIG priors on the inverse variance provides a flexible way to model uncertainty in the data, while pseudo-observations (in the form of pseudo-data points generated by the probabilistic encoder) provide an additional source of information that can be used to update the model's parameters.",

Specifically:\n\n* The mean of the posterior distribution is a weighted sum of the means of the prior and the likelihood: \u03b3^* = \u03b3 + \u03a8/\u03bd\n* The variance of the posterior distribution is also a weighted sum: \u03a3^* = 1/(2\u03b1^*) = (\u03a3 + \u03bd/2)/(2\u03b1^*)\n\nThe pseudo-observations are essentially the theoretical \"weights\" that contribute to these sums. They capture the idea that each data point has some inherent value or importance in updating the model parameters.\n\nIn the context of our system, the pseudo-observations represent the expected contributions from each data point to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. By incorporating these pseudo-observations into the prior distribution, we can effectively \"weight\" the contributions from each data point and generate a more robust and accurate posterior distribution.",
                "3.5FINALOB": "The use of a Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution as a prior for model parameters in Bayesian inference can be motivated by several theoretical considerations related to pseudo-observations.\n\nIn general, when we incorporate prior knowledge into a Bayesian model, our goal is to obtain a posterior distribution that reflects both the observed data and our prior beliefs. The NIG distribution serves as a conjugate prior for many normal likelihood models, which means that the posterior distribution of the parameters will also be a member of the same family.\n\nThe Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution has several desirable properties:\n\n1. **Conjugacy**: As mentioned earlier, the NIG is a conjugate prior for the normal likelihood, meaning that the posterior distribution of the parameters will have the same form as the NIG.\n2. **Flexibility**: The NIG can be used to model a wide range of distributions by adjusting its shape and scale parameters.\n3. **Non-informative prior**: By setting the shape parameter (\u03b1) to zero, we obtain an improper prior, which is non-informative about the parameters.\n\nThe concept of pseudo-observations comes into play when we consider the relationship between the NIG prior and pseudo-data. Pseudo-data are artificial observations that are designed to incorporate prior knowledge or uncertainty estimates into our inference process.\n\nIn the context of normal likelihood models with NIG priors, pseudo-observations can be viewed as a way to regularize the model parameters. The idea is that we want to penalize certain values of the parameters more heavily than others, based on our prior knowledge about their behavior.\n\nThe NIG distribution provides a convenient way to achieve this regularization by using its shape parameter (\u03b1) and scale parameter (\u03b2) to define a \"weighting\" or \"penalty\" function for each parameter. The idea is that parameters with larger values of \u03b1 are more heavily penalized, while those with smaller values of \u03b1 are less penalized.\n\nIn practice, pseudo-observations are often used in conjunction with NIG priors to estimate the hyperparameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2) of the prior distribution. By incorporating pseudo-observations into our model, we can update our prior knowledge about the parameters based on the observed data, while also reflecting our initial uncertainty estimates.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a simple example where we want to estimate the mean of a normal distribution with unknown parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6. We might use a NIG prior with \u03b1=0.5 and \u03b2=1.0 as our prior knowledge about these parameters. By incorporating pseudo-observations into our model, we can update our prior knowledge based on the observed data, while also reflecting our initial uncertainty estimates.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical motivation behind using a Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution as a prior for model parameters is to provide a flexible and conjugate prior that allows us to incorporate prior knowledge about the parameters into our inference process.

This means that the model learns to assign different weights to each class label based on its predicted probability.\n\nThe predictor `p(yi|zi)` produces balanced predictive distributions by using these re-weighted parameters to normalize the probabilities of each class label. In other words, the model outputs a probability distribution over all possible class labels, where the probabilities are proportional to their weights in the NIG distribution.\n\nTo produce balanced predictive distributions, the VIR framework ensures that the minority classes (those with fewer samples) receive sufficient attention and weighting from the model.

The NIG is a probability distribution that combines the normal and t-distributions to model heavy-tailed data.\n\nSpecifically, the re-weighted parameters are obtained by weighting the parameters of the normal distribution with the corresponding t-distribution weights, which are calculated using the `t-dens` function from the `scipy.stats` library in Python. These weights represent the proportion of data points that fall within a certain number of standard deviations (tau) from the mean.\n\nThe re-weighted parameters are then used to compute the predictive distribution for each output value `yi`, given the input values `zi`. This is done using a weighted sum of the normal and t-distribution densities, with the weights representing the proportion of data points that fall within each region.\n\nTo produce balanced predictive distributions with corresponding uncertainty estimation, the VIR algorithm uses the re-weighted parameters to compute the variance-covariance matrix of the predictive distribution. The variance-covariance matrix is used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions, and it is obtained by taking the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function.\n\nThe use of re-weighted parameters from the NIG distribution allows the VIR algorithm to produce balanced predictive distributions with corresponding uncertainty estimation, even in the presence of heavy-tailed data. This is because the NIG distribution can capture both the normal and t-distribution components of the data, allowing for more accurate modeling of the underlying probability distribution.\n\nIn summary, the predictor `p(yi|zi)` incorporates re-weighted parameters from a NIG distribution to produce balanced predictive distributions with corresponding uncertainty estimation.

However, it can be problematic when dealing with imbalanced regression tasks where both classes have similar variability.\n\n**DER**: DER is an optimization-based method that uses differential evolution to adaptively adjust the learning rate and regularization strength for each class. While effective in some cases, it may struggle with extreme class imbalance or high-dimensional spaces.\n\n**Pseudo-counts**: Pseudo-counts (also known as pseudo-likelihood or empirical likelihood) are used to address the issue of imbalanced data by assigning a larger weight to instances from minority classes. By adding a pseudo-likelihood term that encourages the model to predict more accurately for underrepresented classes, pseudo-counts can help mitigate the bias towards majority classes.\n\n**Importance weights**: Importance weights are another technique used to correct for class imbalance.

By giving higher weights to minority-class instances, importance weights can help reduce overfitting to the majority class and improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.\n\nBy incorporating pseudo-counts and importance weights into their framework, the proposed system can effectively address some of the limitations of existing methods like LDS and DER for imbalanced regression tasks. Pseudo-counts provide a way to penalize the model more severely for misclassifying minority-class instances, while importance weights allow the model to adjust its predictions based on the relative importance of each instance.\n\nThis combination of techniques can help improve the robustness and fairness of the system in handling extreme class imbalance and high-dimensional spaces.",

Pseudo-counts in VIR help address this issue by artificially increasing the number of samples from the minority class, thereby reducing the dominance of the majority class.\n\n2. **Importance Weighting**: Importance weights in VIR allow the model to focus on the most informative features and assign more importance to those that are most relevant for predicting the minority class. This helps in reducing overfitting to the majority class and improves overall performance on imbalanced data.\n\n3. **Variance Regularization**: The use of pseudo-counts and importance weights also enables variance regularization, which helps in reducing the variance of the model's predictions. This is crucial for obtaining reasonable uncertainty estimation in imbalanced regression tasks.\n\nBy addressing these limitations, VIR provides a more robust solution for imbalanced regression tasks compared to existing methods like LDS and DER."

The output of the DER layer, which is a derivative of some input, will be approximately equal to the original input.\n\nIn the context of the DER layer implementation, using SoftPlus with \u03b2 = 0.1 can lead to the following interpretation:\n\n* The DER layer computes the derivative of some input `x` with respect to another variable (e.g., state or action).\n* When applying SoftPlus activation function with \u03b2 = 0.1, the output of the DER layer is approximately equal to the original input `x`.\n* This means that the SoftPlus activation function \"softly\" introduces non-linearity in the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n\nHowever, please note that this interpretation is only accurate when \u03b2 = 0.1.

This means that the output of the DER layer will be a scaled and shifted version of the original representation, where the scaling factor depends on the value of the representation.\n\nWith \u03b2 = 0.1, the SoftPlus curve has a gentle slope near zero, which allows for more nuanced representations to capture fine-grained differences between data points. The shape of the curve also helps to prevent the output from becoming too sparse or too dense, as the exponential term dominates the logarithm.\n\nIn practice, this means that the DER layer will produce outputs with:\n\n* A mean value close to the original representation\n* A variance controlled by the SoftPlus scaling factor (which is typically small for \u03b2 = 0.1)\n* A distribution of values that is skewed towards lower values, which can help to capture subtle differences between data points\n\nOverall, using SoftPlus with \u03b2 = 0.1 in the DER layer implementation allows for a flexible and robust representation that can capture complex patterns in the data while avoiding overfitting or underfitting.",
                "3.2METHODO": "I can provide some insight into how the SoftPlus activation function might be interpreted in the context of the Deep Evidential Regression (DER) layer.\n\nIn DER, the activation function is typically used in a probabilistic context, and it's common to use the SoftPlus function, which maps all inputs to positive real numbers. The SoftPlus function with beta set to 0.1 can be interpreted as follows:\n\nSoftPlus(x; \u03b2=0.1) = log(1 + exp(\u03b2x))\n\nThis activation function has two key properties:\n\n1. **Non-linearity**: SoftPlus is a non-linear function that introduces a \"soft\" S-shaped curve, which helps to introduce non-linearity into the model.\n2. **Monotonicity**: The derivative of SoftPlus is always positive, meaning that as the input x increases, the output also increases.\n\nIn the context of DER, the SoftPlus activation function can be seen as introducing a \"soft\" boundary around the mean parameter \u03b3i. When the input x (in this case, the latent variable zi) is close to 0, the SoftPlus output will be small and positive, indicating that the model is more confident in the mean value.\n\nHowever, when x increases, the SoftPlus output grows rapidly, indicating that the model becomes more uncertain about the mean value. This can help to introduce a \"soft\" boundary around the mean, allowing for smooth interpolation between different classes.\n\nThe choice of \u03b2=0.1 is likely intended to control the steepness of this S-shaped curve. A smaller value of \u03b2 (e.g., 0.01) would result in a less steep curve, while a larger value (e.g., 1.0) would result in a more rapid growth of the output.\n\nWithout more information about the specific implementation of the DER layer, it's difficult to provide a definitive interpretation of the SoftPlus activation function with \u03b2 set to 0.1.

When \u03b2 = 0.1, the SoftPlus function has a relatively gentle slope, which means it will output values close to 0 for negative inputs and values around 1 for positive inputs.\n\nIn DER layers, the activation function is used to introduce non-linearity in the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between input features and target variables. The SoftPlus function has several desirable properties that make it suitable for DER:\n\n* It is differentiable everywhere, which makes it easy to optimize using backpropagation.\n* It outputs values in a range that is consistent with many real-world energy values (e.g., log(1 + e^x) \u2248 x for x > 0).\n* It has a relatively low capacity to represent complex functions compared to other activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid, which makes it more suitable for DER where the goal is to learn a good approximation of the underlying distribution rather than a specific function.\n\nOverall, when \u03b2 = 0.1, the SoftPlus activation function in a DER layer can be seen as introducing a smooth, non-linear bias term that helps the model learn a good representation of the target energy values.",

The value of beta determines how \"aggressive\" the transformation is.\n\nA beta value close to 0 (e.g., 0.01) would result in a more gradual transformation, whereas a higher beta value (e.g., 10) would lead to a more dramatic transformation. In this case, with beta = 0.1, the transformation is relatively moderate.\n\nIn terms of the DER layer's behavior:\n\n* A lower output from SoftPlus indicates that the ensemble member has produced a prediction with high confidence.\n* A higher output from SoftPlus suggests that the ensemble member has produced a prediction with lower confidence.\n\nTherefore, when beta = 0.1, the DER layer is likely to produce more balanced and nuanced predictions compared to smaller or larger values of beta. The moderate transformation helps to smooth out the outputs from individual ensemble members, resulting in a more robust and reliable final prediction.\n\nPlease note that this interpretation assumes that the DER layer is designed to use SoftPlus activation with beta = 0.1 as part of its implementation.

                "1INTRODUCT": "Based on my understanding of the paper and its context, I can provide some general insights into the types of imbalanced regression problems that are commonly encountered in real-world applications.\n\nImbalanced regression problems often arise when there is a significant disparity between the number of instances for each class in the training data. This can be due to various reasons such as:\n\n1. **Class imbalance**: In many applications, one or more classes have significantly fewer instances than others. For example, in medical diagnosis, the rare disease might have only 10% of the total cases.\n2. **Asymmetry in feature distributions**: The features (e.g., images, text) used for regression tasks can also be imbalanced. This can occur when certain features are more informative or relevant to one class than others.\n3. **Outliers and noise**: Outliers and noisy data points can skew the distribution of the target variable, leading to imbalanced regression problems.\n\nSome real-world applications where imbalanced regression is commonly encountered include:\n\n1. **Visual age estimation**: As mentioned in the paper, visual age estimation involves predicting a person's age from their image, which can be challenging due to the class imbalance between younger and older adults.\n2. **Medical diagnosis**: In medical diagnosis, rare diseases or conditions might have fewer instances in the training data, leading to imbalanced regression problems.\n3. **Financial risk prediction**: In financial risk assessment, predicting the likelihood of a loan being default might involve imbalanced data where most loans are not defaulting.\n4. **Traffic flow prediction**: Predicting traffic flow can be challenging due to class imbalance between different time periods (e.g., rush hour vs. off-peak hours).\n5. **Energy consumption forecasting**: Forecasting energy consumption can also involve imbalanced regression problems, as the data might be skewed towards periods with low or high energy demand.\n\nThese are just a few examples of applications where imbalanced regression problems can arise. The specific challenges and characteristics of each application can lead to unique imbalanced regression scenarios.\n\nIn summary, while the paper primarily focuses on the proposed Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) model, understanding the types of imbalanced regression problems that occur in real-world applications is essential for developing effective models like VIR.",
                "3METHOD": "In real-world applications, imbalanced regression problems are commonly encountered in scenarios where there is a significant class imbalance between the positive and negative classes. Here are some examples of typical imbalanced regression problems:\n\n1. **Medical diagnosis**: In medical diagnosis, a small number of patients may have a rare disease (e.g., cancer) compared to the majority who do not have it. Accurately predicting the presence or absence of this rare disease is an imbalanced regression problem.\n2. **Credit risk assessment**: Credit institutions often need to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on historical data. In many cases, a small proportion of borrowers default on their loans, making default prediction an imbalanced regression problem.\n3. **Quality control in manufacturing**: In quality control, manufacturers may want to predict the probability of defective products based on various factors such as material composition or production conditions. If only a few products are defective, predicting this small minority is an imbalanced regression problem.\n4. **Energy consumption prediction**: Predicting energy consumption for buildings or homes can be challenging due to the variability in usage patterns. If most days have normal usage, predicting just a few rare instances of high or low usage is an imbalanced regression problem.\n5. **Anomaly detection**: Anomaly detection problems involve identifying outliers or unusual patterns in data that are significantly different from the majority. Examples include detecting credit card fraud, network intrusions, or unusual behavior in financial transactions.\n\nThese examples illustrate how imbalanced regression problems arise in various real-world domains where there is a significant class imbalance between positive and negative classes.",

Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Medical diagnosis**: In medical diagnosis, the classes (e.g., healthy vs. diseased) often have vastly different frequencies. For instance, in cancer diagnosis, the majority of patients may be healthy, while a small proportion have cancer.\n2. **Credit scoring**: Credit scoring models often predict a continuous score based on various factors, but the minority class (defaulters or bad credit) tends to dominate the data.\n3. **Energy efficiency prediction**: Predicting energy consumption in buildings or homes can result in an imbalanced dataset, where most samples have normal energy consumption levels, while a smaller subset represents extreme cases (e.g., power outages or unusually high consumption).\n4. **Insurance claims processing**: Insurance companies often deal with imbalanced datasets when predicting claim payouts, as the majority of claims are small and minor, while fewer are large and costly.\n5. **Stock market prediction**: Predicting stock prices can lead to an imbalanced dataset, where most samples represent stable or increasing prices, while a smaller subset represents significant price drops or crashes.\n6. **Customer churn analysis**: Analyzing customer churn in telecommunications or banking often results in an imbalanced dataset, where the majority of customers remain active, while a smaller proportion are at risk of churning.\n7. **Quality control and defect detection**: Predicting defective products can lead to an imbalanced dataset, where most samples represent normal or acceptable products, while a smaller subset represents defective ones.\n\nThese examples highlight that imbalanced regression problems are widespread in real-world applications, where the minority class often has significant consequences (e.g., incorrect diagnosis, poor business decisions, or financial losses).",

This can occur due to various reasons such as:\n\n1. **Costly or rare events**: In many industries, certain events or outcomes are rare and costly, making it more expensive to detect them early on. For example, predicting the likelihood of credit card fraud or medical diagnoses for a rare disease.\n2. **Asymmetric costs**: The cost of false positives (e.g., incorrectly detecting a healthy individual as diseased) might be higher than the cost of false negatives (e.g., missing a critical disease diagnosis).\n3. **Imbalanced data distributions**: Data may not follow a balanced distribution, leading to an uneven representation of classes in the training dataset.\n4. **Quality of training data**: Noisy or biased data can exacerbate class imbalance issues.\n\nExamples of real-world imbalanced regression problems include:\n\n1. **Medical diagnosis**: Predicting disease outcomes (e.g., cancer diagnosis) where one class represents healthy individuals and another represents diseased individuals, with the latter being less common.\n2. **Finance**: Credit risk assessment, where default events are rare but costly to manage.\n3. **Quality control**: Detecting defects in manufacturing processes, where defective products are relatively few compared to non-defective ones.\n4. **Recommendation systems**: Rating prediction for movies or products, where some users have very few ratings (i.e., classes), while others provide more feedback.\n\nThese examples illustrate the types of imbalanced regression problems encountered in real-world applications, highlighting the need for techniques like those described in the paper to address class imbalance and improve predictive performance.",

Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Medical Diagnosis**: In medical diagnosis, certain diseases may be rare but severe (e.g., cancer), while common conditions may be more frequent (e.g., colds). For instance, detecting diabetes from blood samples often requires balancing the minority class of patients with undiagnosed diabetes against the majority of those without.\n2. **Financial Risk Assessment**: In credit scoring and risk assessment, a small number of high-risk borrowers may outweigh the larger number of low-risk individuals. This imbalance can lead to biased models that underestimate true risks or overestimate false positives.\n3. **Image Classification**: Image classification tasks often involve rare events (e.g., detecting unusual objects in images). These events are less frequent than typical examples, making the minority class more challenging to predict accurately.\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**: In sentiment analysis, there may be a small number of negative reviews or tweets amidst a larger volume of positive ones. This imbalance can make it difficult for models to learn accurate representations of both sentiments.\n5. **Time Series Forecasting**: In some time series forecasting applications (e.g., stock price prediction), rare events like economic downturns or unexpected changes may be less common than more mundane trends, making them harder to predict accurately.\n\nIn these scenarios, traditional machine learning algorithms can suffer from poor performance on the minority class, leading to suboptimal results.

This leads to an imbalanced dataset, where the minority class (disease) has fewer samples compared to the majority class (healthy).\n2. **Recommendation Systems**: In recommendation systems, such as those used in e-commerce or streaming services, the minority class is often the unpopular items or actions that are less likely to be chosen by users.\n3. **Fraud Detection**: In fraud detection, the minority class typically represents legitimate transactions, while the majority class consists of suspicious or fraudulent transactions.\n4. **Quality Control**: In quality control processes, defects (minority class) are often much fewer than normal products (majority class).\n5. **Financial Forecasting**: In financial forecasting, predicting stock prices can be challenging due to the vast majority of samples having high values, while the minority class represents low-value predictions.\n6. **Image Classification**: In image classification tasks, the minority class might represent unusual or rare events, such as detecting specific objects in images.\n\nThese examples illustrate how imbalanced regression problems arise in various domains, where the minority class often has fewer instances than the majority class, making it harder to train accurate models that generalize well to both classes.\n\nIn these cases, techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using cost-sensitive learning methods can help alleviate the issue of class imbalance.",

                "1INTRODUCT": "Based on my knowledge, the choice of dataset can significantly impact the performance of uncertainty estimation methods like VIR. Here are some potential ways in which the choice of dataset might affect VIR's performance:\n\n1. **Imbalanced data**: As mentioned in the system message, VIR is designed to handle imbalanced data by borrowing from neighboring representations with similar regression labels. If the chosen dataset is already imbalanced (e.g., AgeDB-DIR), VIR may perform well on uncertainty estimation tasks. However, if the dataset is relatively balanced (e.g., IMDB-WIKI), VIR might not be able to effectively leverage its ability to borrow from neighboring representations.\n2. **Data quality and distribution**: The quality and distribution of the data can affect how well VIR can estimate uncertainty. For example, a dataset with noisy or missing values may lead to unstable uncertainty estimates. A well-distributed dataset with a clear separation between classes might allow VIR to better capture the underlying patterns and provide more reliable uncertainty estimates.\n3. **Domain knowledge**: The domain knowledge and characteristics of the data can influence how well VIR can estimate uncertainty. For instance, in natural language processing (NLP) tasks like IMDB-WIKI, the relationships between words and phrases may be more complex than in age estimation datasets like AgeDB-DIR. This complexity might require VIR to adjust its approach to uncertainty estimation.\n4. **Class balance**: The balance of classes within the dataset can also impact VIR's performance. If there are few instances of a particular class (e.g., children or elderly), VIR may struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates for those classes.\n\nIn summary, while VIR is designed to handle imbalanced data, the choice of dataset still has significant implications for its performance on uncertainty estimation tasks.

This \"borrowing\" process allows VIR to capture the probabilistic relationships between different classes in the imbalanced dataset.\n\nBy mixing the original representation with these borrowed representations, VIR produces a final probabilistic representation that takes into account both the local and global structures of the data.

The idea is to borrow strength from nearby data points that share similar regression labels to improve the estimation of the representation.\n\nHere's a simplified overview:\n\n1. **Borrowing**: When estimating the representation for a new input, VIR may \"borrow\" information from nearby data points with similar regression labels. This involves using the mean and variance of these neighboring representations.\n2. **Similarity metric**: To identify similar regression labels, VIR might use some similarity metric, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity between the predicted labels.\n3. **Borrowing strength**: The strength of borrowing is typically determined based on the similarity between the new input's label and those of the neighboring data points.\n\nBy leveraging information from nearby data points with similar regression labels, VIR aims to improve the estimation of its probabilistic representations, even in cases where it has limited data or where the dataset is imbalanced.",

The perturbations are applied using a noise schedule that controls the amount of noise added to the original inputs.\n\nThe generated new data points are then used as additional training targets for the model, which is also fine-tuned on the original dataset.

Specifically, given a set of observed data points, we can compute the likelihood of observing those data points under each possible latent configuration (i.e., for each possible value of the latent variables). We then use this likelihood to compute the posterior distribution over the latent variables, which is proportional to the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood.\n\nThe mixture weight for each Gaussian component in the output distribution can be learned by maximizing the evidence (the marginal likelihood) of the data.

                "3METHOD": "To address this question, our VIR (Variance Reduction using Importance Sampling) algorithm is designed to handle imbalanced data and limited sample sizes by incorporating several key components. \n\n1.  **Importance Sampling**: This technique allows us to focus on the most informative samples in the dataset. By calculating the importance of each sample based on its weighted contribution to the overall objective, we can selectively sample from regions that are most relevant for optimization.\n2.  **Variance Reduction Techniques (VRTs)**: Our algorithm leverages VRTs to reduce the variance in the estimates obtained using traditional importance sampling methods. This is particularly important when dealing with limited sample sizes where even small changes in samples can significantly impact performance.\n3.  **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: By employing stochastic gradient descent, our VIR algorithm can efficiently optimize parameters while reducing the computational cost associated with traditional batch optimization methods.

                "3.1PROBLEM": "Based on my knowledge of the system message provided earlier, I can attempt to provide some insights on how VIR (Variance-Reduced Importance Sampling) can achieve stable performance on imbalanced data with limited sample size.\n\nFrom what I understand, VIR is a method that reduces the variance of importance sampling estimates by using probabilistic encoders and predictors. This approach allows for efficient estimation of importance weights even when dealing with high-dimensional data or limited sample sizes.\n\nTo address the challenge of imbalanced data, VIR uses equal-interval bins to partition the label space into B bins. The probabilistic encoder generates representations (zi) that are conditioned on both the input xi and the bin index b. This allows the model to learn a representation for each bin independently, which can help mitigate the effects of class imbalance.\n\nWhen using VIR, the key idea is to sample from the representation distributions (q\u03d5(z|xi; \u03b8)) rather than directly sampling from the data. By doing so, VIR reduces the impact of class imbalance on the importance weights, as the sample distribution is less affected by the minority classes.\n\nFurthermore, VIR's use of mean and variance predictions (y\u0302i, s\u0302i) for each data point also helps to stabilize performance. The mean prediction (y\u0302i) serves as a surrogate for the true label, while the variance prediction (s\u0302i) provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the prediction. This allows VIR to adaptively adjust the importance weights based on the predicted uncertainty, which can help mitigate overfitting or underfitting issues.\n\nIn summary, VIR's use of probabilistic encoders and predictors, equal-interval bins, and adaptive importance weighting scheme enables it to achieve stable performance even on imbalanced data with limited sample sizes.",

Here are some key aspects that contribute to its stability:\n\n1. **Probabilistic representation**: VIR encodes each data point into a probabilistic representation, which allows it to capture uncertainty and variability in the data. This is particularly useful for imbalanced data, where the minority class may have limited samples.\n2. **Calibrated latent space**: By calibrating the latent space using neighboring data points, VIR ensures that the representation is robust to the limited sample size of each class. This calibration process helps to reduce the effects of class imbalance on the model's performance.\n3. **Smoothed statistics**: VIR uses smoothed statistics to compute the mean and covariance of the probabilistic representation. This smoothing process helps to reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data, which can be particularly problematic in imbalanced datasets with limited samples.\n4. **Importance weights**: By applying importance weights calculated from the smoothed label distribution, VIR can reweight the pseudo-counts in the NIG posterior distribution. This allows the model to adapt to the class imbalance and prioritize samples from the minority class when necessary.\n5. **Regularization terms**: The additional regularization term LRi (regularized negative log-likelihood) helps to stabilize the model's performance by encouraging it to produce accurate predictions for all classes, even in the presence of limited sample sizes.\n\nThese aspects combined enable VIR to achieve stable performance on imbalanced data with limited sample sizes by:\n\n* Reducing the impact of class imbalance on the model's performance\n* Capturing uncertainty and variability in the data\n* Robustly handling outliers and noisy data\n* Adapting to the class imbalance through importance weights\n* Encouraging accurate predictions for all classes\n\nOverall, VIR's probabilistic representation, calibration process, and regularization terms work together to ensure that the model can achieve stable performance even on imbalanced data with limited sample sizes.",

By adjusting the weights, the model can focus more on the minority class and reduce the impact of overfitting to the majority class.\n2. **Regularization Terms**: The ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) in VIR includes regularization terms that promote stability and generalization. These terms, such as the KL divergence term, help the model to balance its predictions and prevent overfitting.\n3. **Uncertainty Estimation**: VIR's primary objective is not only to optimize the likelihood but also to estimate the uncertainty of the model's predictions. This allows the model to be more cautious when predicting on underrepresented classes or uncertain data points, which can lead to more stable performance.\n4. **Ensemble Methods**: While not explicitly stated in the original paper, VIR can potentially benefit from ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting. By combining multiple models with different weights, the ensemble can reduce overfitting and improve stability on imbalanced datasets.\n\nTo further enhance performance on imbalanced data with limited sample size, researchers have explored additional techniques, such as:\n\n1. **Data augmentation**: Increasing the size of the dataset through synthetic data generation can help alleviate class imbalance issues.\n2. **Class weighting**: Using more aggressive class weighting schemes, such as the cosine-weighted or exponential-weighted scheme, can give more importance to underrepresented classes.\n3. **Target correction**: Adjusting the loss function to account for class weights and target corrections can help improve performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\nWhile VIR's architecture is designed to promote stability and generalization, it may not be enough to guarantee stable performance on all imbalanced datasets with limited sample size. Additional techniques and modifications might be necessary to achieve optimal results in such scenarios.",
